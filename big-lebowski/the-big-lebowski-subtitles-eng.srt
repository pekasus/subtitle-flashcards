1
00:00:24,952 --> 00:00:27,654
Way out West
there was this fella.

2
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:30,090
Fella I wanna tell you about.

3
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:33,626
Fella by the name
of Jeff Lebowski.

4
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:37,330
At least that was the handle
that his loving parents
gave him.

5
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:40,467
But he never had
much use for it himself.

6
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:44,605
This Lebowski,
he called himself the Dude.

7
00:00:44,606 --> 00:00:46,741
Now Dude,

8
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:50,511
that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.

9
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:55,983
But then there was a lot about
the Dude that didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

10
00:00:55,984 --> 00:00:58,719
and a lot about
where he lived likewise.

11
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,657
But then again,

12
00:01:02,658 --> 00:01:05,826
maybe that's why
I found the place
so darned interesting.

13
00:01:10,832 --> 00:01:14,935
They call Los Angeles
the City of Angels.

14
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:18,072
I didn't find it to be that,
exactly.

15
00:01:18,073 --> 00:01:21,876
But I'll allow there are
some nice folks there.

16
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:24,645
Course, I can't say
I seen London,

17
00:01:24,646 --> 00:01:26,981
and I never been to France,

18
00:01:26,982 --> 00:01:32,086
and I ain't never seen no
queen in her damned undies,
as the fella says.

19
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,088
But I'll tell you what,

20
00:01:34,089 --> 00:01:39,460
after seeing Los Angeles
and this here story
I'm about to unfold,

21
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:42,396
well, I guess
I've seen something

22
00:01:42,397 --> 00:01:46,668
every bit as stupefying
as you can see in any of
those other places,

23
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:48,904
and in English, too.

24
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:51,907
So I can die with
a smile on my face

25
00:01:51,908 --> 00:01:54,707
without feeling like
the good Lord gypped me.

26
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:57,813
Now, this here story
I'm about to unfold

27
00:01:57,814 --> 00:02:00,916
took place back
in the early 90s,

28
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:05,854
just about the time
of our conflict with
Saddam and the lraqis.

29
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:09,524
I only mention it 'cause
sometimes there's a man...

30
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,626
I won't say a hero.

31
00:02:11,627 --> 00:02:13,762
'Cause what's a hero?

32
00:02:13,763 --> 00:02:16,164
But sometimes there's a man...

33
00:02:16,165 --> 00:02:19,267
And I'm talking about
the Dude here.

34
00:02:19,268 --> 00:02:22,037
Sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:26,708
Well, he's the man
for his time and place.

36
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,511
He fits right in there.

37
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,914
And that's the Dude
in Los Angeles.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,718
And even if he is a lazy man,

39
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,421
and the Dude was
most certainly that,

40
00:02:39,422 --> 00:02:43,259
quite possibly the laziest
in Los Angeles county,

41
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,128
which would place him
high in the running
for laziest worldwide.

42
00:02:48,365 --> 00:02:51,267
But sometimes there's a man...

43
00:02:51,268 --> 00:02:54,067
Sometimes there's a man...

44
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:59,008
Well, I lost my train
of thought here.

45
00:02:59,009 --> 00:03:00,272
But...

46
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:03,679
Hell, I done introduced him
enough.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,115
...with them all
for a collective action.

48
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,884
This will not stand.

49
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:11,412
This will not stand,
this aggression
against Kuwait.

50
00:03:42,086 --> 00:03:44,488
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

51
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,757
I want that money,
Lebowski.

52
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,326
Bunny says you're
good for it.

53
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,129
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

54
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,565
Where's the money,
Lebowski?

55
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:57,091
Where's the fucking money,

56
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:02,332
It's down there somewhere.
Let me take another look.

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,005
Don't fuck with us.

58
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:09,346
Your wife owes money
to Jackie Treehorn,

59
00:04:09,347 --> 00:04:12,282
that means you owe money
to Jackie Treehorn.

60
00:04:12,283 --> 00:04:14,513
Ever thus to deadbeats,
Lebowski.

61
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,177
No, don't do...

62
00:04:18,957 --> 00:04:21,692
Not on the rug, man.
MAN: See?

63
00:04:21,693 --> 00:04:25,095
See what happens, Lebowski?
You see what happens?

64
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:28,131
Nobody calls me Lebowski.
You got the wrong guy.

65
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm the Dude, man.

66
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,836
Your name's Lebowski,
Lebowski.

67
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:34,705
Your wife is Bunny.

68
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,941
My wife? Bunny?

69
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:40,010
Do you see a wedding ring
on my finger?

70
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:42,380
Does this place look like
I'm fucking married?

71
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:44,543
The toilet seat's up, man!

72
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,559
What the fuck is this?

73
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,756
Obviously you're
not a golfer.

74
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,566
Woo?
Yeah.

75
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,229
Isn't this guy supposed
to be a millionaire?

76
00:05:05,671 --> 00:05:06,797
WOO: Fuck.

77
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,108
Yeah. What do you think?

78
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,477
He looks like
a fucking loser.

79
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,313
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

80
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:17,115
Fucking time-waster.

81
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,982
Thanks a lot,
asshole.

82
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:31,284
I'm throwing rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

83
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:35,889
WALTER: I'm telling you,
this was a valued rug.
This was a...

84
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,492
Yeah, man. It really
tied the room together.

85
00:07:38,493 --> 00:07:40,194
This was
a valued...

86
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:42,063
What tied the room
together, Dude?
My rug.

87
00:07:42,064 --> 00:07:43,631
Were you listening
to the Dude's story,
Donny?

88
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:44,799
What?
Walter.

89
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,601
Were you listening
to the Dude's story?
I was bowling.

90
00:07:47,602 --> 00:07:49,937
So you have no frame of
reference here, Donny.

91
00:07:49,938 --> 00:07:52,873
You're like a child who
wanders into the middle of
a movie and wants to know...

92
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:56,343
Walter, what's
the point, man?
There's no reason,
here's my point, Dude.

93
00:07:56,344 --> 00:07:58,079
There's no fucking reason
why these two...

94
00:07:58,079 --> 00:07:59,313
Yeah, Walter,
what's your point?

95
00:07:59,314 --> 00:08:01,415
Walter, what is the...

96
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,918
Look, we all know
who is at fault here.

97
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,187
What the fuck are
you talking about?
Huh?

98
00:08:06,188 --> 00:08:08,918
No, what the fuck
are you... I'm not...

99
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:11,926
We're talking about
unchecked aggression
here, Dude.

100
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:13,627
What the fuck is
he talking about?
My rug.

101
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:15,496
Forget it, Donny!
You're out of
your element!

102
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:18,165
Walter, the Chinaman
who peed on my rug,

103
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,100
I can't go
give him a bill!

104
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:21,836
So what the fuck
are you talking about?

105
00:08:21,837 --> 00:08:23,037
What the fuck are
you talking about?

106
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:25,272
The Chinaman is not
the issue here, Dude!

107
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:27,942
I'm talking about
drawing a line in
the sand, Dude.

108
00:08:27,943 --> 00:08:30,444
Across this line
you do not...

109
00:08:30,445 --> 00:08:34,615
Also, Dude, "Chinaman"
is not the preferred
nomenclature.

110
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,317
Asian-American,
please.

111
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:39,821
Walter, this isn't a guy
who built the railroads
here. This is a guy...

112
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:41,590
What the fuck
are you...

113
00:08:41,591 --> 00:08:44,659
- Walter, he peed
on my rug!
- He peed on
the Dude's rug.

114
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,294
Donny, you're out
of your element.

115
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:49,664
Dude, the Chinaman
is not the issue here.

116
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,167
So, who...
Jeff Lebowski.

117
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:55,370
The other Jeffrey Lebowski.
The millionaire.

118
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:58,206
That's fucking
interesting, man.
That's fucking interesting.

119
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:02,277
Plus, he has the
wealth, obviously,
and the resources,

120
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:04,880
so that there's no reason,
there's no fucking reason

121
00:09:04,881 --> 00:09:07,682
why his wife should
go out and owe money
all over town,

122
00:09:07,683 --> 00:09:10,218
and then they come
and they pee on your
fucking rug!

123
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,553
- Am I wrong?
- No.

124
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,188
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah, but...

125
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:14,322
WALTER: Okay then.

126
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:19,161
That rug really tied
the room together,
did it not?

127
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:21,162
- Fucking A.
- And this guy peed on it.

128
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,564
Donny, please.

129
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,832
You know, this is
the fucking guy...

130
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,201
I could find this
fucking Lebowski guy.

131
00:09:26,202 --> 00:09:28,637
His name is Lebowski?
That's your name, Dude.

132
00:09:28,638 --> 00:09:33,008
This is the guy who
should compensate me
for the fucking rug.

133
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:36,712
His wife goes out and
owes money all over town,
and they pee on my rug?

134
00:09:36,713 --> 00:09:38,848
They pee on
your fucking rug?

135
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,545
Peed on my fucking rug.
That's right, Dude.

136
00:09:42,986 --> 00:09:45,319
They peed on
your fucking rug.

137
00:09:46,924 --> 00:09:48,691
This is the study.

138
00:09:48,692 --> 00:09:51,394
As you can see, the various
commendations, awards...

139
00:09:51,395 --> 00:09:55,364
"Jeffrey Lebowski."
...citations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

140
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:59,101
Very impressive.
Oh, please feel free
to inspect them.

141
00:09:59,102 --> 00:10:01,804
Oh. No, I'm not really...
Oh, please. Please.

142
00:10:01,805 --> 00:10:03,839
That is the key to
the city of Pasadena,

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,278
which Mr. Lebowski received
two years ago in recognition
of his various civic...

144
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:14,050
Oh! That's the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce
Business Achiever Award,

145
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,285
which is given...
Oh, not necessarily
given every year.

146
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,486
Hey, is this...

147
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:18,788
Given only when there's
a worthy somebody...

148
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,156
Is this him with Nancy?

149
00:10:20,157 --> 00:10:23,492
Yes, indeed,
that is Mr. Lebowski
with the first lady, yes.

150
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:24,794
It was taken
when Mrs. Reagan...

151
00:10:24,795 --> 00:10:27,530
That's Lebowski
on the left there?

152
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,333
Of course. Mr. Lebowski,
on the left...
So he's a...

153
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:33,002
You know, a handicapped
kind of guy?

154
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:35,165
Mr. Lebowski is
disabled, yes.

155
00:10:35,873 --> 00:10:39,109
This picture was taken
when Mrs. Reagan was
first lady of the nation.

156
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,277
Yes, yes.

157
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:42,312
Not of California.
Good shot.

158
00:10:42,313 --> 00:10:44,615
In fact, he met privately
with the President,

159
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:47,451
though, unfortunately,
there wasn't enough time
for a photo opportunity.

160
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:49,486
- Oh, Nancy's pretty good.
- Oh, wonderful woman.

161
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:51,855
We were very happy to...
These are...

162
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:54,625
Oh, those are
Mr. Lebowski's
children, so to speak.

163
00:10:54,626 --> 00:10:55,993
Different mothers, huh?

164
00:10:55,994 --> 00:10:58,395
No, they're not...
Racially, he's
pretty cool?

165
00:11:00,064 --> 00:11:01,932
They're not literally
his children.

166
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,268
They're the Little Lebowski
Urban Achievers,

167
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,371
inner city children
of promise, but without
the necessary means for...

168
00:11:07,372 --> 00:11:09,473
Necessary means for
a higher education,

169
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,976
so Mr. Lebowski is
committed to sending
all of them to college.

170
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:14,378
Excuse me.
Oh, geez.

171
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:16,280
Thank you. Thank you.

172
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:20,741
- Far out. Think he's got
room for one more?
- One... Oh.

173
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:23,720
You never went to college.

174
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,856
- Please, don't touch that.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, I did,

175
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:28,225
but, you know,
I spent most of my time

176
00:11:28,226 --> 00:11:31,461
occupying various
administration buildings,

177
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:33,330
smoking a lot
of Thai stick,

178
00:11:33,331 --> 00:11:36,601
breaking into the ROTC
and bowling.

179
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:38,832
Tell you the truth, Brandt,
I don't remember most of it.

180
00:11:44,643 --> 00:11:47,879
Okay, sir.
You're a Lebowski,
I'm a Lebowski.

181
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,714
That's terrific.

182
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:52,582
But I am very busy,
as I imagine you are.

183
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:55,453
What can I do for you, sir?

184
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:59,057
Well, sir,
it's this rug I have.

185
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:01,159
It really tied
the room together.

186
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,928
You told Brandt
on the phone.
He told me.

187
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,454
Where do I fit in?

188
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:09,434
Well, they were looking
for you, these two guys.

189
00:12:09,435 --> 00:12:11,502
You know, they...
I'll say it again.

190
00:12:11,503 --> 00:12:14,706
You told Brandt on the phone.
He told me.

191
00:12:14,707 --> 00:12:16,841
I know what happened.
Yes, yes.

192
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:20,144
Oh, so you know that
they were trying to
piss on your rug.

193
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,413
Did I urinate on your rug?

194
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:24,749
You mean, did you personally
come and pee on my rug?

195
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,818
Hello! Do you speak
English, sir?

196
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:28,753
Parla usted ingles?

197
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:31,621
I'll ask you again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

198
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:35,127
No. Like I said,
Woo peed on my rug.

199
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:36,895
I just want to
understand this, sir.

200
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:40,899
Every time a rug
is micturated upon
in this fair city,

201
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,735
I have to compensate
the person?

202
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:46,038
Come on, man.
I'm not trying to
scam anybody here.

203
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,940
You know, I'm just...

204
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:51,468
You're just looking for
a handout like every other...

205
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:55,111
Are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

206
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:58,617
Wait. Let me explain
something to you.

207
00:12:58,618 --> 00:13:00,552
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

208
00:13:00,553 --> 00:13:03,589
You're Mr. Lebowski.
I'm the Dude.

209
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,191
So that's what you call me.
You know?

210
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,327
That or His Dudeness,

211
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:10,896
or Duder or, you know,

212
00:13:10,897 --> 00:13:13,999
El Duderino, if you're not
into the whole brevity thing.

213
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,991
Are you employed, sir?

214
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:18,771
Employed?

215
00:13:19,873 --> 00:13:24,676
You don't go out looking for
a job dressed like that,
do you? On a weekday?

216
00:13:24,677 --> 00:13:26,145
Is this a...

217
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:29,381
- What day is this?
- Well, I do work, sir.

218
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:33,620
- So, if you don't mind...
- No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

219
00:13:33,621 --> 00:13:35,455
This will not stand, you know.

220
00:13:35,456 --> 00:13:38,057
This aggression
will not stand, man.

221
00:13:38,058 --> 00:13:39,893
I mean,
your wife owes money...

222
00:13:39,894 --> 00:13:42,929
My wife is not
the issue here!

223
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,399
I hope that someday
my wife will learn to
live on her allowance,

224
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,867
which is ample.

225
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,804
But if she does not,
that is her problem,
not mine,

226
00:13:50,805 --> 00:13:52,505
just as the rug
is your problem.

227
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:56,543
Just as every bum's
lot in life is his
own responsibility,

228
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,345
regardless of who
he chooses to blame.

229
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:02,515
I didn't blame anyone
for the loss of my legs.

230
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:05,051
Some Chinaman took them
from me in Korea.

231
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,554
But I went out
and achieved anyway.

232
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:11,952
I cannot solve
your problems, sir.
Only you can.

233
00:14:14,094 --> 00:14:16,596
- Well, fuck it.
- Oh, fuck it.

234
00:14:16,597 --> 00:14:19,732
Yes, that's your answer.
That's your answer
to everything.

235
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,568
Tattoo it on your forehead!

236
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,137
Your revolution is over,
Mr. Lebowski!

237
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:27,474
Condolences! The bums lost!

238
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:30,743
My advice to you is to do
what your parents did!

239
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,680
Get a job, sir!

240
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:35,282
The bums will
always lose!

241
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:37,151
Do you hear me,
Lebowski?

242
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:39,553
The bums will
always lose.

243
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:43,190
How was your meeting,
Mr. Lebowski?

244
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:44,758
Okay.

245
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,251
The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

246
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,697
Well, enjoy.

247
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:52,333
And perhaps we'll see you
again sometime, Dude.

248
00:14:52,334 --> 00:14:53,534
Yeah, sure.

249
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:56,470
If I'm in the neighborhood,
you know,

250
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,068
and I need to use the john.

251
00:15:10,719 --> 00:15:12,880
- Blow on them.
- Huh?

252
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,221
Go ahead. Blow.

253
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,360
You want me to blow
on your toes?

254
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:21,989
Uh-huh.

255
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:24,497
I can't blow that far.

256
00:15:30,739 --> 00:15:32,874
Are you sure he won't mind?

257
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:36,044
BUNNY: Uli doesn't
care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

258
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,346
Oh, that must be exhausting.

259
00:15:38,347 --> 00:15:40,215
You're not blowing.

260
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:43,051
Our guest has to
be getting along,
Mrs. Lebowski.

261
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:44,451
Oh!

262
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:46,422
You're Bunny.

263
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,885
I'll suck your cock
for $1 ,000.

264
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:56,298
Wonderful woman.

265
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:58,500
We're all very fond of her.
Very free-spirited.

266
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:01,197
Brandt can't watch though,
or he has to pay $100.

267
00:16:02,738 --> 00:16:04,365
That's marvelous.

268
00:16:06,742 --> 00:16:09,371
I'm just gonna go
find a cash machine.

269
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:16,042
I'm slamming them tonight!

270
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:18,520
You guys are dead
in the water.

271
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:21,490
WALTER: All right!
Way to go, Donny!

272
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:24,993
"lf you will it,
it is no dream."

273
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:28,496
Fucking 20 minutes late, man.
What the fuck is that?

274
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:30,599
Theodore Herzl.
Huh?

275
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,736
State of lsrael.
If you will it, Dude,
it is no dream.

276
00:16:33,737 --> 00:16:35,738
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

277
00:16:35,739 --> 00:16:38,708
The carrier. What's in
the fucking carrier?
Huh?

278
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,711
Oh! Cynthia's dog.
Think it's a Pomeranian.

279
00:16:41,712 --> 00:16:43,813
Can't leave him home alone
or he eats the furniture.

280
00:16:43,814 --> 00:16:46,649
I'm watching it
while Cynthia and Marty
Ackerman are in Hawaii.

281
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,651
You brought a fucking
Pomeranian bowling?

282
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,252
What do you mean,
brought it bowling?

283
00:16:50,253 --> 00:16:53,356
I didn't rent it shoes.
I'm not buying it
a fucking beer.

284
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:55,524
He's not taking your
fucking turn, Dude.

285
00:16:55,525 --> 00:16:58,928
Man, if my fucking ex-wife
asked me to take care of
her fucking dog

286
00:16:58,929 --> 00:17:00,796
while she and her boyfriend
went to Honolulu,

287
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:03,432
I'd tell her to
go fuck herself.
Why can't she board it?

288
00:17:03,433 --> 00:17:05,368
First of all, Dude,
you don't have an ex.

289
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,637
Secondly, this is
a fucking show dog
with fucking papers.

290
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:11,440
You can't board it.
It gets upset.
lts hair falls out.

291
00:17:11,441 --> 00:17:13,843
Walter...
Fucking dog has
fucking papers.

292
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:16,579
Over the line!
Huh?

293
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,015
I'm sorry, Smokey.
You were over the line.
That's a foul.

294
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:20,750
Bullshit. Mark it eight, Dude.

295
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:23,986
Excuse me. Mark it zero.
Next frame.

296
00:17:23,987 --> 00:17:26,989
Bullshit, Walter.
Mark it eight, Dude.

297
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:29,660
Smokey, this is not Nam.
This is bowling.
There are rules.

298
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:32,462
Hey, Walter, come on.
Hey, man, it's Smokey.

299
00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:34,731
So his toe slipped over
a little, you know.

300
00:17:34,732 --> 00:17:36,967
It's just a game, man.
This is a league game.

301
00:17:36,968 --> 00:17:39,002
This determines who enters
the next round robin.

302
00:17:39,003 --> 00:17:40,837
Am I wrong?
SMOKEY: Yeah, but I wasn't...

303
00:17:40,838 --> 00:17:43,440
- Am I wrong?
- Yeah, but I wasn't over.

304
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:46,243
Give me the marker, Dude.
I'm marking an eight.

305
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:47,973
- Smokey, my friend,

306
00:17:48,846 --> 00:17:51,882
...you're entering a world of pain.
- Walter, man.

307
00:17:51,883 --> 00:17:55,685
You mark that frame an
eight, you're entering
a world of pain.

308
00:17:55,687 --> 00:17:58,321
- I'm not...
- A world of pain.

309
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:00,524
Look, Dude,
this is your partner.

310
00:18:00,525 --> 00:18:02,959
Has the whole world
gone crazy?

311
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,829
Am I the only one
around here who gives
a shit about the rules?

312
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,130
Mark it zero!

313
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:09,366
They're calling the cops, man.
Put the piece away.

314
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:12,469
Mark it zero!
DUDE: Walter,
put the piece away.

315
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:14,771
Walter.
You think I'm fucking
around here?

316
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:16,399
Mark it zero!

317
00:18:23,181 --> 00:18:25,549
All right. It's fucking zero.

318
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,609
You happy,
you crazy fuck?

319
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,980
It's a league game,
Smokey.

320
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,460
You can't do that, man.

321
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:38,262
These guys, you know,
they're like me,
they're pacifists.

322
00:18:38,263 --> 00:18:40,932
Smokey was a
conscientious objector.

323
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:43,835
You know, Dude,
I myself dabbled in
pacifism at one point.

324
00:18:43,836 --> 00:18:45,203
Not in Nam, of course.

325
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:48,773
And you know he's got
emotional problems, man.

326
00:18:48,774 --> 00:18:51,275
You mean, beyond pacifism?

327
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:53,973
He's fragile.
He's very fragile.

328
00:18:56,748 --> 00:18:58,649
I did not know that.

329
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,619
Well, it's all water
under the bridge.

330
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,689
And we do enter
the next round robin.

331
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:07,058
- Am I wrong?
- No, you're not wrong.

332
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:08,893
Am I wrong?
You're not wrong, Walter.

333
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,394
You're just an asshole.

334
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:11,896
Okay then.

335
00:19:11,897 --> 00:19:13,631
Play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.

336
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,532
They should be pushovers.

337
00:19:17,102 --> 00:19:19,270
Man, would you just...

338
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,105
Just take it easy, man.

339
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,474
You know, that's your answer
for everything, Dude.

340
00:19:23,475 --> 00:19:26,444
Let me point out something.
Pacifism is not...

341
00:19:26,445 --> 00:19:29,348
Look at our current
situation with that
camel fucker in lraq.

342
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:31,383
Pacifism is not something
to hide behind.

343
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:33,751
Just take it easy, man.

344
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:36,321
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

345
00:19:36,322 --> 00:19:39,858
Yeah, waving the
fucking gun around?
Calmer than you are.

346
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,759
Will you just take it easy?

347
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,392
Calmer than you are.

348
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:50,469
Dude, this is Smokey.

349
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,471
Look, I don't wanna be
a hard-on about this,

350
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:53,805
and I know
it wasn't your fault,

351
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:55,474
but I just thought
it was fair to tell you

352
00:19:55,475 --> 00:19:57,743
that Gilbert and I will be
submitting this to the league

353
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:00,045
and asking them
to set aside the round.

354
00:20:00,046 --> 00:20:02,781
I don't know,
maybe forfeit it to us.

355
00:20:02,782 --> 00:20:06,118
So, like I say, just thought,
you know, fair warning.

356
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,686
Tell Walter.

357
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:09,021
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:13,123
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Brandt at...

359
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:16,762
Well, at Mr. Lebowski's
office.

360
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:19,364
Please call us
as soon as it's convenient.

361
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:23,168
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Mel Zelnicker

362
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:24,703
of the Southern Cal
Bowling League.

363
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:30,043
I just got an informal report
that a member of your team,
a Walter Sobchak,

364
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:32,412
drew a firearm
during league play.

365
00:20:32,413 --> 00:20:34,047
If this is true, of course,

366
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:35,848
it contravenes a number of
the league's bylaws

367
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:37,545
and also article 27
of the league...

368
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:41,387
Dude.
Hey, Marty.

369
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:43,223
Dude, I finally got...

370
00:20:43,224 --> 00:20:45,488
I got the venue I wanted.

371
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:49,596
I'm performing
my dance quintet,
you know, my cycle,

372
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:52,432
at Crane Jackson's
Fountain Street Theater
on Tuesday night.

373
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:56,665
And, well, I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

374
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,234
I'll be there, man.

375
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:04,410
Dude, tomorrow's
already the tenth.

376
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,008
Far out.

377
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,918
Oh. Oh, all right. Okay.

378
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,684
Just slip the rent
under my door.

379
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,994
ZELNICKER ON MACHINE:
...serious infraction
and examine your standing.

380
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:22,595
Thank you.

381
00:21:24,098 --> 00:21:26,800
Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.

382
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,304
Please do call us
as soon as you get in
and I'll send the limo.

383
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:33,974
I hope you're not avoiding
this call because of the rug,

384
00:21:33,975 --> 00:21:36,710
which I assure you
is not a problem.

385
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:39,446
We need your help, and...

386
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:43,484
Well, we would very
much like to see you.
Thank you. It's Brandt.

387
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:46,287
We've had some
terrible news.

388
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:48,483
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion
in the west wing.

389
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,451
Mr. Lebowski.

390
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:02,697
Funny.

391
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:07,808
I can look back on
a life of achievement,

392
00:22:07,809 --> 00:22:10,077
challenges met,

393
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,212
competitors bested,

394
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,943
obstacles overcome.

395
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:18,986
I've accomplished
more than most men

396
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:21,285
and without
the use of my legs.

397
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,727
What makes a man,
Mr. Lebowski?

398
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,432
Dude.
Huh?

399
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:36,237
Oh, I don't know, sir.

400
00:22:36,238 --> 00:22:39,106
Is it being prepared
to do the right thing,

401
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,905
whatever the cost?

402
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:45,874
Isn't that what
makes a man?

403
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:49,508
Sure, that and
a pair of testicles.

404
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:51,883
You're joking,

405
00:22:54,156 --> 00:22:55,857
but perhaps you're right.

406
00:22:55,858 --> 00:22:57,758
You mind if I do a Jay?

407
00:22:59,695 --> 00:23:00,856
Bunny.

408
00:23:02,932 --> 00:23:04,263
Excuse me?

409
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,159
Bunny Lebowski.

410
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,397
She is the light of my life.

411
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,465
Are you surprised
at my tears, sir?

412
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:17,379
Oh, fucking A.

413
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,871
Strong men also cry.

414
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,487
Strong men also cry.

415
00:23:27,557 --> 00:23:29,992
LEBOWSKl: I received
this fax this morning.

416
00:23:32,963 --> 00:23:36,592
As you can see,
it is a ransom note.

417
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:39,702
DUDE: "We have Bunny."

418
00:23:39,703 --> 00:23:44,006
Written by men who were
unable to achieve on a
level field of play.

419
00:23:44,007 --> 00:23:46,776
"Gather $1 million..."

420
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:50,246
Cowards!
"...in unmarked,
nonconsecutive 20s."

421
00:23:50,247 --> 00:23:53,082
Weaklings!
"Await instructions."

422
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,812
Bums!
"No funny stuff."

423
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,081
Bummer.
Huh?

424
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:03,020
This is a bummer, man.
That's... That's a bummer.

425
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:06,523
Brandt will fill you in
on the details.

426
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:25,949
Mr. Lebowski is prepared
to make a generous offer
to you to act as courier

427
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,585
once we get instructions
for the money.

428
00:24:28,586 --> 00:24:29,820
Why me, man?

429
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:35,392
He believes the culprits
might be the very people
who soiled your rug

430
00:24:35,393 --> 00:24:40,397
and you are in a unique
position to confirm or
disconfirm that suspicion.

431
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:42,265
He thinks the carpet pissers
did this?

432
00:24:42,266 --> 00:24:44,166
Well, Dude,
we just don't know.

433
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:23,267
Fucking Quintana.

434
00:26:24,237 --> 00:26:26,672
That creep can roll, man.

435
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:29,665
- Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude.
- Yeah.

436
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:33,645
No, he's a sex offender
with a record.

437
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:36,715
He did six months in Chino
for exposing himself to an eight-year-old.

438
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:40,085
WALTER: When he moved
to Hollywood, he had
to go door-to-door

439
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,850
to tell everyone
he was a pederast.

440
00:26:42,822 --> 00:26:46,315
DONNY: What's a
pederast, Walter?
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

441
00:26:48,661 --> 00:26:51,330
So, how much
did he give you?

442
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:54,733
20 grand, man.
And, of course,
I still get to keep the rug.

443
00:26:54,734 --> 00:26:56,134
- Just for making a hand-off?
- Yeah.

444
00:26:56,135 --> 00:26:58,502
They gave Dude a beeper.

445
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:02,407
So whenever
these guys call...
What if it's
during a game?

446
00:27:02,408 --> 00:27:05,110
Oh, I told them
if it was during
league play...

447
00:27:05,111 --> 00:27:06,311
What's during
league play?

448
00:27:06,312 --> 00:27:08,847
Life does not
stop and start
at your convenience,

449
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:10,849
you miserable
piece of shit.

450
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,884
- I figure...
- What's wrong with
Walter, Dude?

451
00:27:12,885 --> 00:27:15,487
I figure
it's easy money, you know.
It's all pretty harmless.

452
00:27:15,488 --> 00:27:17,320
She probably
kidnapped herself.

453
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:21,260
- What do you mean, Dude?
- Rug-peers did not do this.

454
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:26,199
Look at it. A young
trophy wife marries
this guy for his money.

455
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,135
She figures he isn't
giving her enough, you know.

456
00:27:29,136 --> 00:27:30,970
She owes money all over town.

457
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:33,206
That fucking bitch!

458
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:35,074
It's all a goddamn fake, man.

459
00:27:35,075 --> 00:27:37,076
It's like Lenin said,

460
00:27:37,077 --> 00:27:42,148
you look for the person
who will benefit
and, you know...

461
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:44,777
- I Am the Walrus?
- You know, you'll...

462
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,520
- You know what I'm trying to say.
- I Am the Walrus.

463
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:50,390
That fucking bitch!
Oh, yeah!

464
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:51,891
- I Am the Walrus.
- That's...

465
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:53,493
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

466
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:56,596
V.l. Lenin, Vladimir llyich Ulyanov!

467
00:27:56,597 --> 00:27:57,864
What the fuck is he talking about?

468
00:27:57,865 --> 00:27:59,766
Fucking exactly what happened to those...

469
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,434
WALTER: That makes me fucking sick!

470
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:04,470
DUDE: Well, what do
you care, Walter?
- Those rich fucks.

471
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:06,506
This whole fucking thing.

472
00:28:06,507 --> 00:28:09,342
I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck

473
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:11,177
so that this fucking strumpet,

474
00:28:11,178 --> 00:28:12,412
this fucking whore, could waltz around...

475
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,914
I don't see any connection with Vietnam, man.

476
00:28:14,915 --> 00:28:16,649
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.

477
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,618
No, Walter, face it,
there isn't any connection.

478
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:20,187
Your roll. Have it your way.

479
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,622
- Your roll.
- But my point is...

480
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:24,388
My point is...
QUINTANA: Are you ready
to be fucked, man?

481
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,860
I see you rolled your way into the semis.

482
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,299
Dios mio, man.

483
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,167
Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up.

484
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:41,439
Yeah? Well, you know,
that's just like your opinion, man.

485
00:28:42,644 --> 00:28:45,813
Let me tell you
something, pendejo.

486
00:28:45,814 --> 00:28:48,115
You pull any of your
crazy shit with us,

487
00:28:48,116 --> 00:28:51,018
you flash a piece out
on the lanes,

488
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:54,021
I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass

489
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:57,219
and pull the fucking trigger
till it goes click.

490
00:28:59,194 --> 00:29:00,527
Jesus.

491
00:29:00,528 --> 00:29:02,262
You said it, man.

492
00:29:02,263 --> 00:29:04,493
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

493
00:29:10,805 --> 00:29:12,205
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

494
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:18,301
BRANDT: They called
about 80 minutes ago.

495
00:31:18,302 --> 00:31:21,004
They want you
to take the money,
drive north on the 405.

496
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,439
They will call you
on the portable phone

497
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,608
with instructions
in about 40 minutes.

498
00:31:24,609 --> 00:31:25,775
One person only.

499
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:28,311
They were very clear on that,
or I'd go with you.
One person only.

500
00:31:28,312 --> 00:31:31,305
- What happened to yourjaw?
- Oh, nothing, man.

501
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,477
Here's the money.

502
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,020
And the phone.

503
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:39,956
Please, Dude, follow
whatever instructions
they give.

504
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,826
All right.
Her life is in your hands.

505
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:44,528
Man, don't say that.

506
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:47,230
Mr. Lebowski
asked me to repeat that,
her life is in your hands.

507
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:48,632
Oh, shit, man.

508
00:31:48,633 --> 00:31:51,067
Her life is in
your hands, Dude.

509
00:31:51,068 --> 00:31:53,731
Report back to us
as soon as it's done.

510
00:32:03,214 --> 00:32:07,550
Where the fuck
are you going, man?
Take the ringer,
I'll drive.

511
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,853
The what?
The ringer.

512
00:32:09,854 --> 00:32:11,481
The ringer, Dude.

513
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:21,299
DUDE: What the...
Have they called yet?

514
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,167
What the hell is this?

515
00:32:23,168 --> 00:32:26,137
My dirty undies, Dude.
The laundry. The whites.

516
00:32:26,138 --> 00:32:30,341
Walter, I'm sure there's
a reason you brought
your dirty undies, man.

517
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,709
That's right, Dude.
The weight.

518
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,110
The ringer cannot look empty.

519
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:35,246
Walter, what the fuck
are you thinking, man?

520
00:32:35,247 --> 00:32:37,248
You're right, Dude.
I got to thinking.

521
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:40,184
I got to thinking,
why should we settle for
a measly fucking 20 grand...

522
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:43,487
We? What the fuck, "we"?
You said you just wanted
to come along.

523
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:45,957
My point, Dude,
is why should we
settle for 20 grand

524
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:48,693
when we can keep
the entire million?
Am I wrong?

525
00:32:48,694 --> 00:32:51,862
Yes, you're wrong. This
isn't a fucking game, man.

526
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:54,265
Oh, but it is a game.
You said so yourself.

527
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,567
She kidnapped herself.
I said I thought...

528
00:33:02,741 --> 00:33:04,800
Dude, here.
MAN: (WITH GERMAN ACCENT)
Who is this?

529
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:09,246
Dude. The bagman, man.
Where do you want us to go?

530
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:10,271
Us?

531
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,009
Shit!

532
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:17,622
Yeah, you know,
me and the driver.

533
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:21,493
I'm not handling the money,
driving the car and talking
on the phone all by my...

534
00:33:21,494 --> 00:33:22,828
Shut the fuck up!

535
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:25,821
- Dude, are you fucking this up?
- Who is that?

536
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:29,835
That is the driver.
I told you...

537
00:33:31,504 --> 00:33:33,472
Oh, shit!
What the fuck's going on?

538
00:33:33,473 --> 00:33:34,940
Walter...
What the fuck is going on?

539
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:39,378
He hung up, man.
You fucked it up.
You fucked it up!

540
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:41,980
- Her life was in
our hands, man.
- Easy, Dude.

541
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:45,951
We're screwed now.
We don't get shit.
They're gonna kill her.

542
00:33:45,952 --> 00:33:48,754
- We're fucked, Walter.
- Nothing is fucked, Dude.

543
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:51,323
Come on.
You're being very un-Dude.

544
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:53,825
They'll call back.
Look, she kidnapped...

545
00:33:54,961 --> 00:33:56,995
You see? Nothing's
fucked here, Dude.

546
00:33:56,996 --> 00:34:00,966
Nothing is fucked.
They're a bunch of
fucking amateurs.

547
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:03,568
Walter, will you just
shut the fuck up?

548
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:06,004
Don't say peep while
I'm doing business here, man.

549
00:34:06,005 --> 00:34:07,974
Okay, Dude.
Have it your way.

550
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,511
But they're amateurs.
Fuck.

551
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:15,348
Dude.

552
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:18,718
MAN: Okay, we proceed
but only if there
is no funny stuff.

553
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,319
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,488
So no funny stuff Okay?

555
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,083
Just tell me where the fuck
you want us to go.

556
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,997
That was the sign, man.

557
00:34:30,998 --> 00:34:34,801
So, all we gotta do
is get her back.

558
00:34:34,802 --> 00:34:37,270
No one's in a position
to complain.

559
00:34:37,271 --> 00:34:39,772
- We keep the baksheesh.
- Yeah, terrific, Walter.

560
00:34:39,773 --> 00:34:42,508
But you haven't told me
how we're gonna get her
back. Where is she?

561
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:44,444
That's the simple part, Dude.

562
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:48,711
We make the hand-off,
I grab one of them and
beat it out of him. Huh?

563
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,585
That's a great plan, Walter.

564
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:54,787
That's fucking ingenious,
if I understand it correctly.

565
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,823
It's a Swiss fucking watch.

566
00:34:56,824 --> 00:35:00,026
That's right, Dude.
The beauty of this
is its simplicity.

567
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:03,362
Once a plan gets too complex,
everything can go wrong.

568
00:35:03,363 --> 00:35:05,198
If there's one thing
I learned in Nam...

569
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:10,236
Dude.

570
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:12,171
MAN: You are coming
to wooden bridge.

571
00:35:12,172 --> 00:35:13,407
When you cross the bridge,

572
00:35:13,408 --> 00:35:16,810
you throw the bag
from the left window
of the moving car.

573
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:17,945
You're being watched.

574
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,582
Fuck.
What'd he say?
Where's the hand-off?

575
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,350
There is no fucking
hand-off, man.

576
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,120
At the wooden bridge
we throw the money
out of the car.

577
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:28,919
We throw the money
out of the moving car.

578
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:32,226
We can't do that, Dude.
That fucks up our plan.

579
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:34,228
Well, call them up
and explain it
to them, Walter.

580
00:35:34,229 --> 00:35:35,562
Your plan is so
fucking simple,

581
00:35:35,563 --> 00:35:37,431
I'm sure they'll
fucking understand it.

582
00:35:37,432 --> 00:35:38,699
That's the beauty of it.

583
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,168
WALTER: Wooden
bridge, huh?
Throw them the money, Walter.

584
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:42,803
We're not fucking around, man.

585
00:35:42,804 --> 00:35:45,139
Okay, Dude, the bridge
is coming up. Give me
the ringer, chop-chop.

586
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,740
Fuck that.
Walter, I love you,

587
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:49,910
but sooner or later you're
gonna have to face the fact
you're a goddamn moron.

588
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:52,346
Okay, Dude. No time to argue.
Hey, man!

589
00:35:52,347 --> 00:35:54,781
Here's the bridge.
Hey, Walter! Hey, Walter!

590
00:35:54,782 --> 00:35:57,513
Hey, Walter!
Here goes the ringer!

591
00:35:58,787 --> 00:36:01,088
What the fuck?
Okay, Dude, you're wheel.

592
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:03,357
Hey, man, what the fuck?
At 15 mph, I roll out.

593
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:05,359
I double back,
grab one of them
and beat it out of him.

594
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,627
The Uzi.
Uzi.

595
00:36:06,628 --> 00:36:08,829
You didn't think I was
rolling out of here
naked, did you?

596
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,532
Walter, please!
Fifteen, Dude! This is it!
Let's take that hill!

597
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:12,797
Walter!

598
00:36:35,624 --> 00:36:38,426
We have it!

599
00:36:38,427 --> 00:36:41,029
We have it!

600
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,964
We have it!

601
00:36:57,513 --> 00:36:59,614
Fuck it, Dude.

602
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,208
Let's go bowling.

603
00:37:39,689 --> 00:37:43,092
Aitz chaim he, Dude,
as the ex used to say.

604
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:44,960
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

605
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:48,130
What the fuck are we
gonna tell Lebowski?

606
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:50,332
Oh, him.

607
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,402
I don't know.
What exactly
is the problem?

608
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:55,269
The problem is...

609
00:37:56,539 --> 00:37:58,374
What do you mean,
what's the...

610
00:37:58,375 --> 00:37:59,899
There was no...

611
00:38:00,777 --> 00:38:02,336
We didn't...

612
00:38:03,446 --> 00:38:05,714
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

613
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:07,650
What the fuck
are you talking about?

614
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:10,252
The poor woman,
that poor slut
kidnapped herself.

615
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:11,655
Come on, Dude.
You said so yourself.

616
00:38:11,656 --> 00:38:14,024
Man, I said I thought
she kidnapped herself.

617
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,592
You're the one who's
so fucking certain.

618
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,228
That's right, Dude.
100% certain.

619
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,030
They posted the next round
for the tournament.

620
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,364
Donny, shut the fuck...

621
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,466
When do we play?
This Saturday. Quintana and...

622
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,268
Saturday? Well, they'll
have to reschedule.

623
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:27,704
Walter, what am l
gonna tell Lebowski?

624
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:31,107
I told that fuck
down at the league office.
Who's in charge of scheduling?

625
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:32,742
Walter!
Burkhalter.

626
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:35,779
I told that kraut
a fucking thousand times,
I don't roll on shabbos!

627
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,180
Walter!
They already posted it.

628
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:38,848
Well, they can
fucking un-post it!

629
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:42,252
Who gives a shit?
They're gonna kill
that poor woman, man!

630
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,587
What am I gonna
tell Lebowski?
Come on, Dude.

631
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,691
Eventually she'll get tired
of her little game and,
you know, wander on back.

632
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,292
How come you don't roll
on Saturday, Walter?

633
00:38:49,293 --> 00:38:50,560
I'm shomer shabbos.

634
00:38:50,561 --> 00:38:52,562
- What's that, Walter?
- Yeah, and in the meantime,

635
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,064
what do I tell Lebowski?

636
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:56,499
Saturday, Donny, is shabbos,
the Jewish day of rest.

637
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,035
That means I don't work,
I don't drive a car,

638
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:00,603
I don't fucking
ride in a car,

639
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,539
I don't handle money,
I don't turn on the oven

640
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,667
and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

641
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,743
Sheesh.

642
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:08,269
Shomer shabbos!

643
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:13,017
- Walter, how am I gonna...
- Shomer fucking shabbos!

644
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:16,354
- Oh, fuck! That's it. I'm out of here.
- Oh, come on, Dude.

645
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,156
Dude! Dude!

646
00:39:22,427 --> 00:39:23,828
You just tell him...

647
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:26,297
Tell him we made the drop
and everything went,
you know...

648
00:39:26,298 --> 00:39:27,431
Oh, yeah.
How'd it go?

649
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:29,400
Went all right.
Dude's car got
a little dinged up.

650
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,869
Walter, we didn't make
the fucking hand-off, man!

651
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:34,004
They didn't get
the fucking money!

652
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,339
And they're gonna...
They're gonna...

653
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,008
They're gonna kill
that poor woman.

654
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:39,777
They're gonna kill
that poor woman!

655
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,312
Walter, if you can't
ride in a car,

656
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:42,780
then how do you get
around on shabbos?

657
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:44,882
Really, Dude,
you surprise me.

658
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,283
They're not gonna
kill shit.

659
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:47,485
They're not gonna do shit.

660
00:39:47,486 --> 00:39:49,186
What can they do to her?
Bunch of fucking amateurs.

661
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:51,122
And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.

662
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,457
Who's sitting on a million
fucking dollars?

663
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:54,658
Am I wrong?
Walter.

664
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,828
Who's got a fucking
million fucking dollars
sitting in the trunk of our car?

665
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,931
Our car, Walter?
And what do they got?
My dirty undies.

666
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,559
My fucking whites!

667
00:40:08,674 --> 00:40:10,006
Say, Dude?

668
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,911
Where is your car?

669
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:16,148
- Who's got your undies, Walter?
- Where's your car, Dude?

670
00:40:16,149 --> 00:40:18,242
You don't know,
Walter?

671
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:22,648
WALTER: It was parked
in a handicap zone.
Perhaps they towed it.

672
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:26,358
You fucking know
it's been stolen.

673
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:29,260
Well, certainly that's
a possibility, Dude.

674
00:40:30,663 --> 00:40:32,063
Oh, fuck it.

675
00:40:34,634 --> 00:40:38,103
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.

676
00:40:38,104 --> 00:40:41,267
- Phone's ringing, Dude.
- Thank you, Donny!

677
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:57,915
Yeah.

678
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:04,423
Green with some brown,
rust coloration.

679
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:08,868
And was there anything
of value in the car?

680
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:10,303
Oh, yeah.

681
00:41:11,705 --> 00:41:16,040
A tape deck, some Creedence
tapes, and there was a...

682
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:20,137
My briefcase.

683
00:41:22,749 --> 00:41:24,376
In the briefcase?

684
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:27,681
Papers.

685
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:29,988
Just papers.

686
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,393
You know, my papers,
business papers.

687
00:41:36,063 --> 00:41:39,396
- And what do you do, sir?
- I'm unemployed.

688
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:45,771
My rug was also stolen.

689
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:48,141
Your rug was in the car?

690
00:41:48,142 --> 00:41:49,837
No. Here.

691
00:41:50,544 --> 00:41:52,205
Separate incidents.

692
00:41:54,181 --> 00:41:56,015
DUDE ON MACHINE:
The Dude is not in.

693
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,883
Do you find them much,
these stolen cars?

694
00:41:59,953 --> 00:42:01,285
Sometimes.

695
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:04,657
Wouldn't hold out much hope
for the tape deck though.

696
00:42:04,658 --> 00:42:06,526
Or the Creedence.

697
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:10,487
What about the briefcase?

698
00:42:11,065 --> 00:42:12,533
WOMAN: Mr. Lebowski,
I'd like to see you.

699
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:14,535
Call when you get home
and I'll send a car for you.

700
00:42:14,536 --> 00:42:18,272
My name is Maude Lebowski.
I'm the one who took your rug.

701
00:42:18,273 --> 00:42:21,333
Well, guess we can
close the file
on that one.

702
00:43:12,962 --> 00:43:15,863
I'll be with you in
a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

703
00:43:34,383 --> 00:43:37,885
Does the female form
make you uncomfortable,
Mr. Lebowski?

704
00:43:37,886 --> 00:43:41,756
- Is that what this is a picture of?
- In a sense, yes.

705
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:44,525
My art has been commended
as being strongly vaginal,

706
00:43:44,526 --> 00:43:45,693
which bothers some men.

707
00:43:45,694 --> 00:43:48,630
The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.

708
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:51,299
Vagina.
Oh, yeah?

709
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,835
Yes, they don't like
hearing it and find it
difficult to say,

710
00:43:53,836 --> 00:43:55,270
whereas without
batting an eye,

711
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:59,469
a man will refer to his dick,
or his rod or his johnson.

712
00:44:00,743 --> 00:44:01,843
"Johnson"?

713
00:44:01,844 --> 00:44:04,612
All right, Mr. Lebowski,
let's get down to cases.

714
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:07,149
My father told me he agreed
to let you have the rug,

715
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:11,220
but as it was a gift
from me to my late mother,
it was not his to give.

716
00:44:11,221 --> 00:44:13,121
Now, your face.

717
00:44:14,391 --> 00:44:16,291
As for this kidnapping.

718
00:44:16,426 --> 00:44:17,493
Huh?

719
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:20,996
Yes, I know all about it,
and I know that you acted
as courier.

720
00:44:20,997 --> 00:44:24,333
Let me tell you something.
The whole thing stinks to
high heaven.

721
00:44:24,334 --> 00:44:28,637
Yeah, right, but let me
explain something about
the rug.

722
00:44:28,638 --> 00:44:30,868
Do you like sex,
Mr. Lebowski?

723
00:44:31,841 --> 00:44:35,244
- Excuse me?
- Sex, the physical act of love. Coitus.

724
00:44:35,245 --> 00:44:38,547
- Do you like it?
- I was talking about my rug.

725
00:44:38,548 --> 00:44:41,150
You're not interested in sex?

726
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:43,519
- You mean coitus?
- I like it, too.

727
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,888
It's a male myth about
feminists that we hate sex.

728
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:48,390
It can be a natural,
zesty enterprise.

729
00:44:48,391 --> 00:44:49,858
However, there are
some people,

730
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:52,895
it is called
satyriasis in men,
nymphomania in women,

731
00:44:52,896 --> 00:44:56,131
who engage in it compulsively
and without joy.

732
00:44:56,132 --> 00:44:59,234
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

733
00:44:59,235 --> 00:45:03,205
These unfortunate souls
cannot love, in the true
sense of the word.

734
00:45:03,206 --> 00:45:06,776
Our mutual acquaintance,
Bunny, is one of these.

735
00:45:06,777 --> 00:45:09,079
Listen, Maude,

736
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,349
I'm sorry if your stepmother
is a nympho,

737
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,819
but, you know, I don't see
what this has to do with...

738
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,619
You have any Kahlua?
Take a look at this, sir.

739
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:23,991
DUDE: Oh, I know that guy.

740
00:45:25,596 --> 00:45:27,792
He's a nihilist.

741
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,201
"Karl Hungus."

742
00:45:44,849 --> 00:45:46,349
Hi.
Hello.

743
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:49,386
Mein dispatcher says
there is something
wrong with dein Kabel.

744
00:45:49,387 --> 00:45:50,587
Yeah. Come on in.

745
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:53,123
I'm not really sure
exactly what's really
wrong with the cable.

746
00:45:53,124 --> 00:45:55,792
That's why they sent me.
I am an expert.

747
00:45:55,793 --> 00:45:57,160
The TV's in here.

748
00:45:57,161 --> 00:46:00,358
- You recognize her, of course.
- Helga, bring my tools.

749
00:46:03,267 --> 00:46:05,102
That's my friend Sherry.

750
00:46:05,103 --> 00:46:06,871
She just came over
to use the shower.

751
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:09,306
The story is ludicrous.

752
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:12,343
My name is Karl.
lch bin expert.

753
00:46:12,344 --> 00:46:14,478
You must be here
to fix the cable.

754
00:46:14,479 --> 00:46:17,415
Lord, you can imagine
where it goes from here.

755
00:46:17,416 --> 00:46:18,949
He fixes the cable?

756
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,085
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

757
00:46:21,086 --> 00:46:24,455
Little matter to me that
this woman chose to pursue
a career in pornography,

758
00:46:24,456 --> 00:46:27,191
nor that she has been
banging Jackie Treehorn,

759
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:29,026
to use the parlance
of our times.

760
00:46:29,027 --> 00:46:33,063
However,
I am one of the two trustees
of the Lebowski Foundation,

761
00:46:33,064 --> 00:46:34,799
the other being my father.

762
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,867
The foundation takes
youngsters from Watts and...

763
00:46:36,868 --> 00:46:38,335
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

764
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:42,106
Little Lebowski Urban
Achievers, yes, and proud
we are of all of them.

765
00:46:42,107 --> 00:46:46,043
I asked my father about
his withdrawal of $1 million
from the foundation account,

766
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:47,945
and he told me
about this abduction,

767
00:46:47,946 --> 00:46:49,680
but I tell you
it is preposterous.

768
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:53,651
This compulsive fornicator
is taking my father for
the proverbial ride.

769
00:46:53,652 --> 00:46:55,686
Yeah, but my...
I'm getting to your rug.

770
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,488
My father and l
don't get along.

771
00:46:57,489 --> 00:46:59,223
He doesn't approve
of my lifestyle and,

772
00:46:59,224 --> 00:47:00,958
needless to say,
I don't approve of his.

773
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:04,863
However, I hardly
wish to make my father's
embezzlement a police matter.

774
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:07,799
So I'm proposing that you
try to recover the money

775
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,035
from the people
you delivered it to.

776
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,004
Well, I could do that.

777
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:14,973
If you successfully do so,

778
00:47:14,974 --> 00:47:20,312
I will compensate you
to the tune of 10% of
the recovered sum.

779
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:22,414
A hundred...
Thousand. Yes.

780
00:47:22,415 --> 00:47:25,250
Bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

781
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:29,588
Yeah, but what about my...
Your rug, yes.

782
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:32,257
Well, with that money
you can buy any
number of rugs

783
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:34,960
that don't have sentimental
value for me.

784
00:47:34,961 --> 00:47:37,562
And I am sorry about
that crack on the jaw.

785
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:40,098
Oh, that's fine.
That doesn't even...

786
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:42,734
Here's the name and
number of a doctor who
will look at it for you.

787
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,369
You will receive no bill.

788
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:46,037
He's a good man
and thorough.

789
00:47:46,038 --> 00:47:47,739
That's thoughtful but...

790
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:51,233
Please see him, Jeffrey.
He's a good man and thorough.

791
00:47:52,845 --> 00:47:55,007
Oh, well, all right.

792
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:57,782
So he says, "My wife's
a pain in the ass.

793
00:47:57,783 --> 00:48:00,285
"She's always busting
my frigging agates.

794
00:48:00,286 --> 00:48:03,556
"My daughter's married
to a loser bastard.

795
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:07,526
"l got a rash
so bad on my ass
I can't even sit down.

796
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:09,795
"But you know me,
I can't complain."

797
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:11,664
Oh, fucking A, man.

798
00:48:11,665 --> 00:48:14,396
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

799
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:18,104
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

800
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:21,307
earlier today I was really
feeling shitty, man.

801
00:48:21,308 --> 00:48:23,309
Really down in the dumps.

802
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:24,777
Lost a little money...

803
00:48:24,778 --> 00:48:28,281
Hey, you know what?
Forget about it, huh?
Forget about it.

804
00:48:28,282 --> 00:48:29,615
Yeah, fuck it, man.

805
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:32,518
You can't be worried
about that shit.
Life goes on, man.

806
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:35,216
Well, home, sweet home,
Mr. L.

807
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,326
TONY: Hey, yo. Come here.

808
00:48:40,327 --> 00:48:42,819
Who's your friend
in the Volkswagen?
Huh?

809
00:48:44,698 --> 00:48:46,999
TONY: Yeah.
He followed us here.

810
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,002
When did he start...
Whoa! What the fuck?

811
00:48:50,003 --> 00:48:52,204
Get in the limo,
you son of a bitch!
No arguments!

812
00:48:52,205 --> 00:48:55,073
Hey! Hey! Careful, man!
There's a beverage here!

813
00:48:56,743 --> 00:48:59,278
Start talking,
and talk fast,
you lousy bum.

814
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:01,214
We've been frantically
trying to reach you, Dude.

815
00:49:01,215 --> 00:49:03,741
Where is my goddamn money,
you bum?

816
00:49:05,286 --> 00:49:08,088
Well, we... I don't...

817
00:49:08,089 --> 00:49:10,457
They did not receive
the money, you nitwit!

818
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,159
They did not
receive the money!

819
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,528
Her life was
in your hands!

820
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:16,129
This is our concern, Dude.

821
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,265
No, man.
Nothing is fucked here.

822
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:20,267
- Nothing is fucked?
- No, man.

823
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:24,171
The goddamn plane
has crashed into
the mountain!

824
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:28,475
Man, come on.
Who are you gonna
believe, those guys or...

825
00:49:28,476 --> 00:49:30,310
We dropped off the damn money.

826
00:49:30,311 --> 00:49:31,608
We?

827
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:35,983
l, the royal we.

828
00:49:35,984 --> 00:49:37,417
You know. The editorial...

829
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:39,553
I dropped off the money
exactly as per...

830
00:49:39,554 --> 00:49:43,423
Look, man, I've got
certain information.
All right?

831
00:49:43,424 --> 00:49:45,993
Certain things have
come to light and...

832
00:49:45,994 --> 00:49:48,695
You know, has it ever
occurred to you

833
00:49:48,696 --> 00:49:54,234
that instead of, you know,
running around, blaming me...

834
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:56,503
You know, given the nature
of all this new shit,

835
00:49:56,504 --> 00:50:02,443
you know, this could be
a lot more complex...

836
00:50:02,444 --> 00:50:07,482
I mean, it's not just...
It might not be just such
a simple... You know?

837
00:50:07,483 --> 00:50:11,085
What in God's holy name
are you blathering about?

838
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:13,521
Well, I'll tell you what
I'm blathering about.

839
00:50:13,522 --> 00:50:15,556
I've got information, man.

840
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:17,392
New shit has come to light.

841
00:50:17,393 --> 00:50:19,361
And, shit, man,

842
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,230
she kidnapped herself.

843
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:29,070
Well, sure, man.
Look at it. You know?

844
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:33,107
A young trophy wife,
in the parlance of
our times, you know.

845
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:38,274
She owes money
all over town, including
to known pornographers.

846
00:50:40,182 --> 00:50:42,446
And that's cool.
That's cool.

847
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:47,221
I'm saying she
needs money, man.

848
00:50:47,222 --> 00:50:50,886
And, you know,
of course they're gonna
say they didn't get it

849
00:50:52,194 --> 00:50:55,096
because she wants more, man.

850
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:57,532
She's gotta feed the monkey.
I mean...

851
00:50:59,869 --> 00:51:03,038
Hasn't that ever
occurred to you, man?

852
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:04,097
Sir?

853
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:09,745
No, Mr. Lebowski,
it had not occurred
to me.

854
00:51:09,746 --> 00:51:12,047
That had not
occurred to us, Dude.

855
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:13,582
Well, okay, you know?

856
00:51:13,583 --> 00:51:18,187
You guys aren't privy
to all the new shit,
so, you know...

857
00:51:18,188 --> 00:51:21,657
But, hey, that's what you...
That's what you pay me for.

858
00:51:23,993 --> 00:51:25,194
Speaking of which,

859
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:29,598
do you think that you could
give me my $20,000 in cash?

860
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,668
My concern is, and
I've gotta check it
with my accountant,

861
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:35,471
that this might bump me up
into a higher tax...

862
00:51:35,472 --> 00:51:38,066
Brandt, give him
the envelope.

863
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:42,845
Oh, well, if you've
already got the check
made out, that's cool.

864
00:51:42,846 --> 00:51:44,837
BRANDT: We received this
this morning.

865
00:51:47,383 --> 00:51:50,853
Since you have
failed to achieve,

866
00:51:50,854 --> 00:51:54,423
even in the modest task
which was your charge,

867
00:51:54,424 --> 00:51:57,693
since you have
stolen my money,

868
00:51:57,694 --> 00:52:01,464
since you have
unrepentantly
betrayed my trust,

869
00:52:01,465 --> 00:52:05,502
I have no choice
but to tell these bums

870
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,804
to do whatever is necessary

871
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:11,935
to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

872
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,347
And with Brandt as my witness,
I will tell you this,

873
00:52:17,348 --> 00:52:20,717
any further harm
visited upon Bunny

874
00:52:20,718 --> 00:52:24,313
will be visited tenfold
upon your head.

875
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:28,157
By God, sir,

876
00:52:28,692 --> 00:52:31,685
I will not abide another toe.

877
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:37,800
I hear the cottonwoods
whispering above

878
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:39,929
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

879
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:44,807
- Whose toe was it, Walter?
- How the fuck should I know?

880
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:48,378
- I do know that nothing
about it indicates...
- The nail polish, Walter.

881
00:52:48,379 --> 00:52:49,779
Fine, Dude.

882
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:53,750
As if it's impossible to get
some nail polish, apply it
to someone else's toe...

883
00:52:53,751 --> 00:52:55,118
Someone else...
Pinking shears.

884
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:56,553
Where the fuck are
they gonna get...

885
00:52:56,554 --> 00:52:59,423
You want a toe?
I can get you a toe.

886
00:52:59,424 --> 00:53:01,425
Believe me,
there are ways, Dude.

887
00:53:01,426 --> 00:53:03,761
- You don't wanna know
about it, believe me.
- Yeah, but, Walter...

888
00:53:03,762 --> 00:53:07,264
Hell, I could get you a toe
by 3:00 this afternoon
with nail polish.

889
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:09,266
- These fucking amateurs.
- Walter...

890
00:53:09,267 --> 00:53:12,169
They send us a toe,
we're supposed to shit
ourselves with fear.

891
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,837
- Jesus Christ!
- Walter...

892
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:16,006
- The point is...
- They're gonna kill her, Walter,

893
00:53:16,007 --> 00:53:17,741
and then they're
gonna kill me.

894
00:53:17,742 --> 00:53:20,211
Dude, that's...

895
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,747
That's just the
stress talking, man.

896
00:53:23,748 --> 00:53:28,886
Now, so far we have
what appears to me to be
a series of victimless crimes.

897
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:31,522
- What about the toe?
- Forget about the fucking toe!

898
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:34,725
Excuse me, sir.
Could you please
keep your voices down?

899
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:36,594
This is a family restaurant.

900
00:53:36,595 --> 00:53:39,096
Oh, please! Dear,
for your information,

901
00:53:39,097 --> 00:53:41,999
the Supreme Court
has roundly rejected
prior restraint.

902
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,435
Come on. Walter,
this is not a First
Amendment thing, man.

903
00:53:44,436 --> 00:53:47,705
Sir, if you don't calm down,
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

904
00:53:47,706 --> 00:53:50,875
Lady, I got buddies
who died face down
in the muck

905
00:53:50,876 --> 00:53:53,677
so that you and I can enjoy
this family restaurant!

906
00:53:53,678 --> 00:53:57,082
All right,
I'm out of here.
Hey, Dude, don't go away, man.

907
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:01,042
Come on. This affects
all of us, man! lt's
our basic freedoms!

908
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:07,258
I'm staying.

909
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:11,453
I'm finishing my coffee.

910
00:54:16,335 --> 00:54:18,099
Enjoying my coffee.

911
00:54:34,353 --> 00:54:36,588
DUDE ON MACHINE:
The Dude is not in.

912
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:39,524
Leave a message
after the beep.
It takes a minute.

913
00:54:40,626 --> 00:54:44,429
Mr. Lebowski,
this is Duty Officer.
Rolvaag of the LAPD.

914
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,031
We've recovered
your automobile.

915
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,401
It can be claimed
at the North Hollywood
Auto Circus there on Victory.

916
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:50,602
Their hours there are...

917
00:54:50,603 --> 00:54:52,237
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

918
00:55:02,616 --> 00:55:05,984
Hey! This is a private
residence, man.

919
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,192
Oh, nice marmot.

920
00:55:25,972 --> 00:55:30,142
(WITH GERMAN ACCENT)
Where is the money, Lebowski?
We wants the money, Lebowski!

921
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,352
You think we are kidding or
making with the funny stuff?

922
00:55:39,353 --> 00:55:41,787
We could do things
you haven't dreamed of,
Lebowski.

923
00:55:41,788 --> 00:55:45,791
Ja, we believes in nothing.
We believes in nothing,
Lebowski. Nothing!

924
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:49,195
And tomorrow we come back
and we cut off your johnson.

925
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:52,531
Excuse me?
I said, we cut off
your johnson!

926
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:55,035
Just think about that,
Lebowski.

927
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:57,037
Your wiggly penis, Lebowski.

928
00:55:57,038 --> 00:55:59,370
Ja. Maybe we stomp on it
and squish it.

929
00:56:08,349 --> 00:56:12,853
MAN: It was discovered
last night in Van Nuys
lodged against an abutment.

930
00:56:12,854 --> 00:56:14,721
DUDE: Oh, man. Lodged where?

931
00:56:14,722 --> 00:56:17,090
You're lucky she didn't
get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

932
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:19,593
- Oh, man!
- Must've been
a joyride situation.

933
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:22,229
They abandoned the vehicle
once they hit the retaining
wall.

934
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:25,665
Oh, my fucking
briefcase, man!
It's not here! Shit!

935
00:56:25,666 --> 00:56:27,434
Yeah, I saw that
on the report. Sorry.

936
00:56:27,435 --> 00:56:29,460
You gotta get in
on the other side.

937
00:56:30,505 --> 00:56:33,668
The side view was found
on the road by the car.

938
00:56:35,243 --> 00:56:39,179
You're lucky they left
the tape deck though,
and the Creedence.

939
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:42,249
Oh, Jesus!
What's that smell, man?

940
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,385
Yeah. It's probably
a vagrant slept in the car.

941
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:48,221
Or maybe just used it
as a toilet and moved on.

942
00:56:48,222 --> 00:56:49,485
Hey, man,

943
00:56:50,792 --> 00:56:52,526
are you gonna find these guys?

944
00:56:52,527 --> 00:56:57,056
Or, you know, I mean...
You got any promising
leads or...

945
00:56:57,366 --> 00:56:59,000
Leads?

946
00:56:59,001 --> 00:57:00,668
Yeah. Sure.

947
00:57:00,669 --> 00:57:04,005
I'll just check with the boys
down at the crime lab.

948
00:57:04,006 --> 00:57:07,909
They got four more detectives
working on the case.

949
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,537
They got us working in shifts!

950
00:57:15,017 --> 00:57:16,177
Leads!

951
00:57:16,985 --> 00:57:19,487
DUDE: My only hope is that
the big Lebowski kills me

952
00:57:19,488 --> 00:57:21,289
before the Germans
can cut my dick off.

953
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:22,523
Leads!

954
00:57:22,524 --> 00:57:24,258
Now, that is just
ridiculous, Dude.

955
00:57:24,259 --> 00:57:26,094
No one's going to
cut your dick off.

956
00:57:26,095 --> 00:57:28,696
- Thank you, Walter.
- Not if I have anything
to say about it.

957
00:57:28,697 --> 00:57:29,831
Thank you, Walter.

958
00:57:29,832 --> 00:57:31,966
- That makes me feel very secure.
- Dude?

959
00:57:31,967 --> 00:57:34,969
- That makes me feel
very warm inside, man.
- Dude?

960
00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:37,805
This whole fucking thing.

961
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:41,142
I could be sitting here
with just pee stains on
my rug.

962
00:57:41,143 --> 00:57:44,479
- But no, man,
I got a, you know...
- Yeah. Fucking Germans.

963
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,640
Nothing changes.

964
00:57:46,715 --> 00:57:50,384
- Fucking Nazis.
- They were Nazis, Dude?

965
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:53,021
Oh, come on, Donny.
They were threatening
castration!

966
00:57:53,022 --> 00:57:54,957
- Uh-huh.
- Are we gonna
split hairs here?

967
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:56,358
- No.
- Am I wrong?

968
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:59,761
- Well, he didn't...
- Man, they were
nihilists, man.

969
00:57:59,762 --> 00:58:02,397
They kept saying they
believed in nothing.

970
00:58:02,398 --> 00:58:03,730
Nihilists.

971
00:58:05,435 --> 00:58:06,732
Fuck me.

972
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:11,673
I mean, say what you
want about the tenets of
national socialism, Dude.

973
00:58:11,674 --> 00:58:14,076
- At least it's an ethos.
- Yeah.

974
00:58:14,077 --> 00:58:16,845
And, also,
let's not forget...
Let's not forget, Dude,

975
00:58:16,846 --> 00:58:19,882
that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent,

976
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:23,519
for, you know,
domestic...

977
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,283
Within the city...

978
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:29,224
- That ain't legal, either.
- What are you, a fucking park ranger now?

979
00:58:29,225 --> 00:58:30,893
No! I'm just
trying to...

980
00:58:30,894 --> 00:58:33,762
Who gives a shit
about the fucking marmot?

981
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:37,032
- We are sympathizing here, Dude.
- Fuck sympathy.

982
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:40,970
I don't need your
fucking sympathy, man.
I need my fucking johnson.

983
00:58:41,938 --> 00:58:45,207
What do you need that for, Dude?
You have got to buck up, man!

984
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:48,110
You cannot drag this
negative energy into
the tournament.

985
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:50,773
Fuck the tournament.
Fuck you, Walter.

986
00:58:53,484 --> 00:58:55,552
Fuck the tournament?

987
00:58:55,553 --> 00:58:58,655
Okay, Dude. I can see
you don't want to be
cheered up here.

988
00:58:58,656 --> 00:59:01,125
Come on, Donny.
Let's go get us a lane.

989
00:59:06,096 --> 00:59:08,759
- Another Caucasian, Gary.
- Right, Dude.

990
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:14,601
- Friends like these, huh, Gary?
- That's right, Dude.

991
00:59:38,529 --> 00:59:42,932
You got a good
sarsaparilla?
Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

992
00:59:42,933 --> 00:59:44,902
Yeah. That's a good one.

993
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:50,373
How're you doing there,
Dude?

994
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:52,468
Not too good, man.

995
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:55,478
One of those days, huh?
Yeah.

996
00:59:56,681 --> 01:00:01,552
Well, a wiser fellow
than myself once said,

997
01:00:01,553 --> 01:00:03,420
"Sometimes you eat
the bear and..."

998
01:00:04,856 --> 01:00:07,057
Much obliged.

999
01:00:07,058 --> 01:00:10,893
"Sometimes the bear,
well, he eats you."

1000
01:00:12,597 --> 01:00:15,399
That some kind of
Eastern thing?

1001
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:16,834
Far from it.

1002
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:25,533
I like your style, Dude.

1003
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:30,881
Oh, well, I dig
your style, too, man.

1004
01:00:30,882 --> 01:00:33,180
Got a whole cowboy thing
going.

1005
01:00:37,589 --> 01:00:39,123
Thank you.

1006
01:00:39,124 --> 01:00:41,125
There's just one thing, Dude.

1007
01:00:41,126 --> 01:00:42,960
What's that?

1008
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:45,589
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

1009
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,300
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1010
01:00:52,571 --> 01:00:55,040
Okay, Dude. Have it your way.

1011
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:59,744
Take her easy, Dude.

1012
01:00:59,745 --> 01:01:01,406
Yeah. Thanks, man.

1013
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,149
Call for you, Dude.

1014
01:01:12,825 --> 01:01:16,661
Hello?
MAUDE: Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

1015
01:01:16,662 --> 01:01:19,831
Oh, yeah, no.
No, I haven't yet.

1016
01:01:19,832 --> 01:01:22,324
I'd like to see you
immediately.

1017
01:01:23,235 --> 01:01:24,259
Oh?

1018
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:40,249
So, you're Lebowski.
Yeah.

1019
01:01:43,122 --> 01:01:45,357
Maude has told me
all about you.

1020
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:47,792
She'll be back in a minute.
Sit down.

1021
01:01:48,227 --> 01:01:51,220
Do you want a drink?
Yeah, sure. White Russian.

1022
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:53,996
The bar's over there.

1023
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:02,975
- So, what do you do,
Lebowski?
- Who the fuck are you, man?

1024
01:02:04,411 --> 01:02:08,347
- Just a friend of Maudie's.
- Yeah? The friend with
the cleft asshole?

1025
01:02:11,418 --> 01:02:14,053
- What do you do?
- Oh, nothing much.

1026
01:02:15,188 --> 01:02:17,189
- Hello, Jeffrey.
- Hello.

1027
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:20,058
Yeah. How are you?
Listen, Maude.

1028
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:22,353
I got to

1029
01:02:24,664 --> 01:02:27,066
tender my resignation
or whatever

1030
01:02:27,067 --> 01:02:32,138
because looks like
your mother really
was kidnapped after all.

1031
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:34,273
She most certainly was not.

1032
01:02:34,274 --> 01:02:39,411
Hey, man, why don't you
fucking listen
occasionally?

1033
01:02:39,412 --> 01:02:42,114
- You might learn something.
- Now, I got...

1034
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:44,950
Please don't call her
my mother.

1035
01:02:44,951 --> 01:02:47,853
She's most definitely
the perpetrator and
not the victim.

1036
01:02:47,854 --> 01:02:50,791
I'm telling you, I've got
pretty definitive evidence.

1037
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:53,693
- From who?
- From the main guy, Uli.

1038
01:02:53,694 --> 01:02:57,062
Uli Kunkel? Her costar
in the beaver picture?

1039
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,902
You mean vagina?
I mean, you know the guy?

1040
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:04,805
I might have introduced them,
for all I know.

1041
01:03:04,806 --> 01:03:07,040
Do you remember Uli?

1042
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:09,910
He's a musician.
Used to have a group,
Autobahn.

1043
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:14,514
Look in my LP's.
They released one
album in the late '70s.

1044
01:03:14,515 --> 01:03:17,584
MAUDE: Their music is
sort of a techno pop.

1045
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:21,054
So he's pretending
to be the abductor?
Well, yeah.

1046
01:03:21,055 --> 01:03:24,524
Look, Jeffrey, you don't
really kidnap someone
you're acquainted with.

1047
01:03:24,525 --> 01:03:29,129
The whole idea is that the
hostage can't identify you
after you've let them go.

1048
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:30,897
Well, I know that.

1049
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:37,737
What the fuck is
with this guy?
Who is he?

1050
01:03:37,738 --> 01:03:41,341
Knox Harrington,
the video artist.

1051
01:03:41,342 --> 01:03:43,242
So, Uli has the money.

1052
01:03:44,478 --> 01:03:48,007
Well, no, not exactly.

1053
01:03:48,884 --> 01:03:50,785
This is a very complicated
case, Maude.

1054
01:03:50,786 --> 01:03:52,887
(PHONE RINGING)
You know, a lot of ins,
a lot of outs,

1055
01:03:52,888 --> 01:03:54,121
a lot of what-have-yous

1056
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:56,791
and a lot of strands
to keep in my head, man.

1057
01:03:56,792 --> 01:03:59,327
You know, a lot of strands
in the old Duder's head.

1058
01:03:59,328 --> 01:04:00,595
Hello?

1059
01:04:00,596 --> 01:04:02,563
If Uli doesn't have it,
then who does?

1060
01:04:02,564 --> 01:04:04,565
It's Sandra
about the Biennale.

1061
01:04:04,566 --> 01:04:08,169
Look. I have to take this.
Do you still have that
doctor's number?

1062
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:11,806
- No, really, it's not even
bruised anymore.
- Oh, please, Jeffrey.

1063
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,976
I don't want to be responsible
for any delayed after-effects.

1064
01:04:17,412 --> 01:04:19,039
After-effects?

1065
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:51,880
Could you slide your shorts
down, Mr. Lebowski, please?

1066
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:52,939
Mmm?

1067
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:55,350
No, no, man.
She hit me right here.

1068
01:04:55,351 --> 01:04:59,015
I understand.
Could you slide your
shorts down, please?

1069
01:07:31,609 --> 01:07:35,179
He lives in
North Hollywood on Radford,
near the ln-N-Out Burger.

1070
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,414
No, the ln-N-Out
Burger's on Camrose.

1071
01:07:37,415 --> 01:07:39,917
- Near the ln-N-Out Burger.
- Those are good burgers,
Walter.

1072
01:07:39,918 --> 01:07:42,886
Shut the fuck up, Donny.
The kid is in the ninth
grade, Dude.

1073
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:45,590
And his father is...
Are you ready for this?

1074
01:07:45,591 --> 01:07:49,027
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

1075
01:07:49,028 --> 01:07:50,695
Who the fuck is that?

1076
01:07:50,696 --> 01:07:53,832
- Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?
- Who the...

1077
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,267
Have you ever
heard of a little show
called Branded, Dude?

1078
01:07:56,268 --> 01:07:57,402
Yes, yes, l...

1079
01:07:57,403 --> 01:07:59,471
"All but one man
died there at
Bitter Creek."

1080
01:07:59,472 --> 01:08:01,806
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

1081
01:08:01,807 --> 01:08:05,944
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

1082
01:08:05,945 --> 01:08:07,745
The bulk of the series.

1083
01:08:07,746 --> 01:08:08,847
Oh.

1084
01:08:08,848 --> 01:08:11,516
- Not exactly
a lightweight.
- No.

1085
01:08:11,517 --> 01:08:13,815
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

1086
01:08:15,354 --> 01:08:18,123
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you.

1087
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:19,891
We'll brace the kid.
Should be a pushover.

1088
01:08:19,892 --> 01:08:21,192
We'll be near
the ln-N-Out Burger.

1089
01:08:21,193 --> 01:08:22,393
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

1090
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:27,899
We'll go out there,
we'll brace the kid.
He should be a pushover.

1091
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:30,101
We'll get that fucking
million dollars back,

1092
01:08:30,102 --> 01:08:32,303
if he hasn't
spent it already.

1093
01:08:32,304 --> 01:08:34,439
A million fucking clams.

1094
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,103
And, yes,
we'll be near the...
ln-N-Out.

1095
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:41,947
- Shh! Shh!
- Some burgers, some beers.
A few laughs.

1096
01:08:44,651 --> 01:08:46,949
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

1097
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:02,501
Oh, fuck me, man.

1098
01:09:02,502 --> 01:09:05,371
That kid's already spent
all the money, man.

1099
01:09:05,372 --> 01:09:07,706
New Vette? Hardly, Dude.

1100
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:13,078
I'd say he still has
$960,000, $970,000 left,
depending on the options.

1101
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,847
Wait in the car, Donny.

1102
01:09:18,952 --> 01:09:20,943
WOMAN: Yes?
- Pilar?

1103
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:26,285
My name is Walter Sobchak.
This is my associate,
Jeffrey Lebowski.

1104
01:09:27,694 --> 01:09:30,095
We came to talk
about little Larry.

1105
01:09:30,096 --> 01:09:32,231
- May we come in?
- Yes, yes.

1106
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:33,563
Thank you.

1107
01:09:37,904 --> 01:09:39,531
That's him, Dude.

1108
01:09:47,081 --> 01:09:49,649
And a good day
to you, sir!

1109
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:51,641
Sit down, please.

1110
01:09:57,058 --> 01:09:59,960
Larry, sweetie,
the man is here!

1111
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:02,862
Is he...
Does he still write?

1112
01:10:02,863 --> 01:10:05,992
Oh, no, no.
He has health problems.

1113
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,361
Uh-huh.

1114
01:10:09,103 --> 01:10:11,162
Sir, I just want to say

1115
01:10:12,173 --> 01:10:14,642
that we're both,
on a personal level,

1116
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:18,178
really enormous fans.

1117
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:21,414
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

1118
01:10:21,415 --> 01:10:23,617
was truly a source
of inspiration.

1119
01:10:23,618 --> 01:10:26,519
PILAR: Sweetie, sit down.
This man is the police.

1120
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:30,190
Oh, no, ma'am. We didn't want
to give the impression that
we were police, exactly.

1121
01:10:30,191 --> 01:10:33,026
We're hoping it
won't be necessary
to call the police.

1122
01:10:33,027 --> 01:10:35,562
But that's up to
little Larry here.

1123
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:37,190
Isn't it, Larry?

1124
01:10:48,076 --> 01:10:50,204
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1125
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:53,948
-Is this your homework, Larry?
- Look, man, it...

1126
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:57,418
Dude. Please?
Is this your
homework, Larry?

1127
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,886
Just ask him about
the car, man.

1128
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,289
Is this yours, Larry?
Is this your homework,
Larry?

1129
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:02,556
Is that your car out front?

1130
01:11:02,557 --> 01:11:05,593
- Is this your homework, Larry?
- We know it's his
fucking homework!

1131
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:07,928
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

1132
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:11,065
Look, Larry, have you
ever heard of Vietnam?

1133
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,434
- For Christ's sake, Walter.
- You are entering
a world of pain, son.

1134
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:16,203
We know that this is
your homework. We know
that you stole the car.

1135
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:18,806
- And the fucking money.
- And the fucking money!

1136
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:20,574
And we know that
this is your homework!

1137
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,876
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

1138
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,845
You're killing
your father, Larry.

1139
01:11:27,015 --> 01:11:29,109
All right.
This is pointless.

1140
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,081
Okay, time for Plan B.

1141
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:38,293
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

1142
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,964
Son, this is what happens
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

1143
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,668
A little language
problem here.

1144
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:49,036
Little prick's
stonewalling me.

1145
01:11:49,906 --> 01:11:51,465
Walter.

1146
01:11:52,175 --> 01:11:54,166
What are you doing, man?

1147
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,610
What are you doing?

1148
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:01,683
Here you go, Larry.

1149
01:12:01,684 --> 01:12:03,752
You see what happens?

1150
01:12:03,753 --> 01:12:05,812
You see what happens, Larry?

1151
01:12:06,556 --> 01:12:08,490
You see what happens?
Oh, great.

1152
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:12,052
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry.

1153
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:16,832
This is what happens, Larry.

1154
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,734
You see what happens, Larry?

1155
01:12:18,735 --> 01:12:21,303
You see what happens
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

1156
01:12:21,304 --> 01:12:23,638
This is what happens!

1157
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:25,841
You see what happens, Larry?

1158
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,310
You see what happens, Larry?

1159
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:32,009
Do you see what happens,
Larry, when you fuck
a stranger in the ass?

1160
01:12:33,249 --> 01:12:34,883
This is what happens, Larry!

1161
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:36,651
This is what happens, Larry!

1162
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:39,455
MAN: My car! My baby!
This is what happens, Larry!

1163
01:12:39,456 --> 01:12:41,524
This is what happens
when you fuck a stranger...

1164
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:44,327
What the fuck are you
doing, man? Stop it!

1165
01:12:44,328 --> 01:12:46,896
Hey, man.
I just bought that
fucking car last week!

1166
01:12:46,897 --> 01:12:50,033
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm sorry!
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1167
01:12:50,034 --> 01:12:53,236
- I just bought the
fucking car last week!
- Come on, man.

1168
01:12:53,237 --> 01:12:55,171
I'll kill your
fucking car, man!

1169
01:12:55,172 --> 01:12:57,273
No, no. Hey, hey,
that's not his! Hey!

1170
01:12:57,274 --> 01:12:59,809
God damn it!
Whoa! Oh, no!

1171
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:01,711
MAN: Fuck you!
Man. No.

1172
01:13:01,712 --> 01:13:04,280
You like that? Fuck you!

1173
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:07,850
I'll kill your fucking car!
DUDE: No. No, no. No.

1174
01:13:07,851 --> 01:13:09,852
I'll kill your fucking car!

1175
01:13:30,774 --> 01:13:32,674
I accept your apology.

1176
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:37,336
No, I just want to handle it
by myself from now on.

1177
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:40,717
No. No. No!

1178
01:13:40,718 --> 01:13:42,516
That has nothing
to do with it.

1179
01:13:43,922 --> 01:13:47,289
Yes, the car made it home.
You're calling me at home.

1180
01:13:48,927 --> 01:13:53,660
No, Walter, it did not look
like Larry was about to crack!

1181
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:57,892
Well, that's your perception.

1182
01:13:59,604 --> 01:14:02,339
You know, Walter,
you're right.

1183
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,374
There is an unspoken
message here.

1184
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:06,810
lt's, "Fuck you!
Leave me the fuck alone!"

1185
01:14:09,747 --> 01:14:11,579
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1186
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:31,068
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

1187
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:32,936
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

1188
01:14:32,937 --> 01:14:35,873
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are,
Lebowski.

1189
01:14:35,874 --> 01:14:38,810
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see the
deadbeat Lebowski.

1190
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:40,677
You're not dealing
with morons here.

1191
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:31,796
Hello, Dude.
Thanks for coming.

1192
01:15:31,797 --> 01:15:33,492
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

1193
01:15:36,402 --> 01:15:39,204
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

1194
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:41,273
Completely unspoiled.

1195
01:15:41,274 --> 01:15:44,506
- What's your drink, Dude?
- A White Russian. Thanks.

1196
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:46,675
White Russian.

1197
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,350
- How's the smut business, Jackie?
- I wouldn't know, Dude.

1198
01:15:51,351 --> 01:15:56,822
I deal in publishing, entertainment,
political advocacy.

1199
01:15:56,823 --> 01:16:00,192
- Which one's Logjammin'?
- Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1200
01:16:00,193 --> 01:16:03,095
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

1201
01:16:03,096 --> 01:16:04,723
It's video, Dude.

1202
01:16:05,565 --> 01:16:07,466
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

1203
01:16:07,467 --> 01:16:10,994
we can't afford to invest
in little extras like story,

1204
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:14,773
production value, feelings.

1205
01:16:16,543 --> 01:16:21,742
You know, people forget that the brain
is the biggest erogenous zone.

1206
01:16:22,382 --> 01:16:24,049
On you maybe.

1207
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:26,051
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

1208
01:16:26,052 --> 01:16:29,021
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

1209
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:31,824
in interactive erotic software.

1210
01:16:31,825 --> 01:16:35,922
Wave of the future, Dude.
100% electronic.

1211
01:16:37,265 --> 01:16:39,859
Well, I still jerk off manually.

1212
01:16:42,169 --> 01:16:46,640
Of course you do.
I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point.

1213
01:16:46,641 --> 01:16:49,442
Well, here it is, Dude.

1214
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,077
Where's Bunny?

1215
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:53,747
- Well, I thought you might know that, man.
- Why would l?

1216
01:16:53,748 --> 01:16:58,084
She only ran off to get away from that
rather sizable debt to me.

1217
01:16:58,085 --> 01:17:00,553
No, she didn't run off.
She's been...

1218
01:17:00,554 --> 01:17:02,756
I heard that kidnapping story, so save it.

1219
01:17:02,757 --> 01:17:04,748
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude.

1220
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:09,562
And I don't care what you're trying
to get from the husband.

1221
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:11,164
That's your business.

1222
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:15,068
All I'm saying is I want mine.

1223
01:17:15,069 --> 01:17:16,403
Yeah, right, man.

1224
01:17:16,404 --> 01:17:20,407
I mean, there are a lot of facets to this,

1225
01:17:20,408 --> 01:17:22,308
a lot of interested parties.

1226
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,041
Excuse me.

1227
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:30,843
Yeah?

1228
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,053
Oh, yeah?

1229
01:17:33,054 --> 01:17:34,487
Where is that?

1230
01:17:38,126 --> 01:17:40,220
All right. Yeah.

1231
01:17:43,231 --> 01:17:44,563
Excuse me.

1232
01:18:20,068 --> 01:18:23,804
- Forgive me.
- No problemo, man.

1233
01:18:23,805 --> 01:18:28,174
So, if I can find your money,

1234
01:18:29,945 --> 01:18:31,912
what's in it for the Dude?

1235
01:18:31,913 --> 01:18:35,150
Well, of course, there's that to discuss.
You want a refill?

1236
01:18:35,151 --> 01:18:38,720
- Yeah, does the pope shit in the woods?
- 10% finder's fee.

1237
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:42,157
- That all right?
- Okay. Done, Jackie.

1238
01:18:43,126 --> 01:18:45,527
I dig the way you do business, man.

1239
01:18:45,528 --> 01:18:49,231
Your money is being held by a kid named
Larry Sellers.

1240
01:18:49,232 --> 01:18:51,962
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford,

1241
01:18:53,169 --> 01:18:55,771
by the ln-N-Out Burger.

1242
01:18:55,772 --> 01:18:56,905
Fucking brat.

1243
01:18:56,906 --> 01:19:01,104
But I'm sure your goons can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.

1244
01:19:03,379 --> 01:19:05,313
Flunking social studies.

1245
01:19:08,718 --> 01:19:11,653
So, if you could just

1246
01:19:11,654 --> 01:19:16,057
write me a check for
my 10% of half a million,

1247
01:19:16,058 --> 01:19:19,119
5 grand,
I'll go out and mingle.

1248
01:19:23,599 --> 01:19:26,034
You mix a hell of
a Caucasian, Jackie.

1249
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:29,629
Fifteen-year-old kid.

1250
01:19:30,373 --> 01:19:34,401
- Is this some sort of a joke?
- No. No joke.

1251
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:39,382
No funny stuff, Jackie.
The kid's got it.

1252
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:40,543
Hi, fellas.

1253
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:44,914
Kid just wanted a car.

1254
01:19:48,192 --> 01:19:51,594
All the Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

1255
01:19:52,062 --> 01:19:53,427
Not greedy.

1256
01:19:55,065 --> 01:19:56,465
It really

1257
01:19:58,101 --> 01:19:59,797
tied the room together.

1258
01:20:02,773 --> 01:20:06,008
MAN: Darkness washed
over the Dude.

1259
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:10,504
Darker than a black steer's tokus on
a moonless prairie night.

1260
01:20:11,482 --> 01:20:14,246
There was no bottom.

1261
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,867
Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

1262
01:23:55,276 --> 01:23:58,678
He was innocent

1263
01:23:59,613 --> 01:24:03,243
Not a charge was true

1264
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:09,515
And they say
he ran away branded

1265
01:24:22,903 --> 01:24:24,735
Is this your only lD?

1266
01:24:25,539 --> 01:24:27,439
I know my rights, man.

1267
01:24:29,578 --> 01:24:31,412
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

1268
01:24:31,413 --> 01:24:34,181
I want a fucking lawyer,
man.

1269
01:24:34,182 --> 01:24:38,347
I want Bill Kunstler, man,

1270
01:24:39,855 --> 01:24:41,655
or Ron Kuby.

1271
01:24:41,656 --> 01:24:44,925
Mr. Treehorn tells us
that he had to eject you

1272
01:24:44,926 --> 01:24:46,917
from his garden party,

1273
01:24:47,362 --> 01:24:49,363
that you were drunk
and abusive.

1274
01:24:49,364 --> 01:24:54,461
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

1275
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:58,172
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

1276
01:24:58,173 --> 01:25:00,641
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1277
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:03,444
Now, we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

1278
01:25:03,445 --> 01:25:06,046
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

1279
01:25:06,047 --> 01:25:08,380
So let me make
something plain.

1280
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:13,012
I don't like you sucking around bothering
our citizens, Lebowski.

1281
01:25:13,755 --> 01:25:16,056
I don't like your jerk-off name.

1282
01:25:16,057 --> 01:25:17,424
I don't like your jerk-off face.

1283
01:25:17,425 --> 01:25:19,126
I don't like your jerk-off behavior.

1284
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:22,063
And I don't like you, jerk-off.

1285
01:25:25,734 --> 01:25:27,634
Do I make myself clear?

1286
01:25:30,773 --> 01:25:32,741
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1287
01:25:34,277 --> 01:25:35,377
Ow!

1288
01:25:35,378 --> 01:25:36,971
Fucking fascist!

1289
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:40,777
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski.

1290
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:43,712
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!

1291
01:25:44,887 --> 01:25:49,558
Keep your ugly, fucking,
gold-bricking ass out of my beach community.

1292
01:26:02,205 --> 01:26:05,473
Jesus, man. Could you
change the channel?

1293
01:26:05,474 --> 01:26:07,209
Fuck you, man!
If you don't like
my fucking music,

1294
01:26:07,210 --> 01:26:08,810
get your own fucking cab!

1295
01:26:08,811 --> 01:26:09,945
I had a really rough...

1296
01:26:09,946 --> 01:26:11,813
I'll pull off to the side
and kick your ass out.

1297
01:26:11,814 --> 01:26:16,513
Man, come on. I had
a rough night, and I hate
the fucking Eagles, man.

1298
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,855
Out of my fucking cab! Out!
Man!

1299
01:26:28,298 --> 01:26:30,494
Man! Man! Hey!

1300
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:15,638
Oh, Jesus!

1301
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:36,829
Jeffrey.

1302
01:27:37,769 --> 01:27:39,635
- Maude?
- Love me.

1303
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:44,374
That's my robe.

1304
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,611
MAUDE: Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

1305
01:27:48,446 --> 01:27:50,676
Well, not much to tell.

1306
01:27:51,816 --> 01:27:57,448
I was one of the authors
of the Port Huron Statement.

1307
01:27:59,057 --> 01:28:01,457
- The original Port Huron Statement.
- Uh-huh.

1308
01:28:01,893 --> 01:28:05,454
Not the compromised
second draft.

1309
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:09,094
Then l...

1310
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:12,869
You ever hear of
the Seattle Seven?

1311
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:14,270
That was me.

1312
01:28:17,508 --> 01:28:19,773
And there were
six other guys.

1313
01:28:21,312 --> 01:28:24,614
And then the music business,
briefly.

1314
01:28:24,615 --> 01:28:26,217
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1315
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:28,019
Roadie for Metallica.

1316
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:29,153
Oh.

1317
01:28:29,154 --> 01:28:30,645
Speed of Sound tour.

1318
01:28:31,023 --> 01:28:32,388
Mmm-hmm.

1319
01:28:32,858 --> 01:28:34,519
Bunch of assholes.

1320
01:28:35,828 --> 01:28:39,195
And then, you know,
little of this, little of that.

1321
01:28:40,566 --> 01:28:43,901
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

1322
01:28:43,902 --> 01:28:47,031
What do you do
for recreation?

1323
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:49,374
Well, the usual.

1324
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:52,173
Bowl, drive around,

1325
01:28:53,645 --> 01:28:55,944
the occasional
acid flashback.

1326
01:29:02,187 --> 01:29:04,355
MAUDE: What happened
to your house?

1327
01:29:04,356 --> 01:29:06,991
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

1328
01:29:06,992 --> 01:29:09,961
He thought I had
your father's money.

1329
01:29:09,962 --> 01:29:13,231
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

1330
01:29:13,232 --> 01:29:15,433
Cocktail?
No, thanks.

1331
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:18,529
It's not my father's money.
It's the foundation's.

1332
01:29:19,038 --> 01:29:22,407
Why did he think you have it?
Who does?

1333
01:29:22,408 --> 01:29:26,945
Oh, Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.
Real fucking brat.

1334
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:30,582
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

1335
01:29:30,583 --> 01:29:32,574
A lot of ins, a lot of outs.

1336
01:29:33,253 --> 01:29:37,890
You know, fortunately,
I'm adhering to a pretty
strict, drug regimen

1337
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:40,225
to keep my mind,
you know, limber,

1338
01:29:40,226 --> 01:29:43,862
and I'm very fucking close
to your father's money.

1339
01:29:43,863 --> 01:29:46,565
I keep telling you,
it's the foundation's
money.

1340
01:29:46,566 --> 01:29:48,193
Father doesn't have any.

1341
01:29:49,769 --> 01:29:52,037
What are you talking about?
He's fucking loaded.

1342
01:29:52,038 --> 01:29:54,336
No, no. The wealth
is all Mother's.

1343
01:29:55,141 --> 01:29:56,609
No, he runs stuff.

1344
01:29:57,010 --> 01:29:59,311
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

1345
01:29:59,312 --> 01:30:02,314
...but he didn't do
very well at it.
- Oh, he's, you know...

1346
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:04,783
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

1347
01:30:04,784 --> 01:30:07,486
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

1348
01:30:07,487 --> 01:30:09,254
He has no money of his own.

1349
01:30:09,255 --> 01:30:11,023
I know how he likes
to present himself.

1350
01:30:11,024 --> 01:30:14,323
Father's weakness is vanity,
hence the slut.

1351
01:30:16,596 --> 01:30:18,189
Do you think he...

1352
01:30:19,732 --> 01:30:21,133
What is that, yoga?

1353
01:30:21,134 --> 01:30:23,501
It increases the chances
of conception.

1354
01:30:26,474 --> 01:30:29,075
- lncreases...
- Well, yes.

1355
01:30:29,076 --> 01:30:32,112
What did you think
this was all about?
Fun and games?

1356
01:30:32,113 --> 01:30:33,637
I want a child.

1357
01:30:34,248 --> 01:30:36,149
Okay, yeah, okay.

1358
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:39,085
But let me... Let me explain
something about the Dude.

1359
01:30:39,086 --> 01:30:42,622
Look, Jeffrey,
I don't want a partner.

1360
01:30:42,623 --> 01:30:46,392
In fact, I don't want
the father to be someone
I have to see socially

1361
01:30:46,393 --> 01:30:49,488
or who will have any interest
in raising the child himself.

1362
01:30:50,931 --> 01:30:54,424
- Oh. So, that doctor...
- Exactly.

1363
01:30:55,503 --> 01:30:58,370
Now, what happened
to your face?

1364
01:30:59,006 --> 01:31:01,207
Did Jackie Treehorn
do that as well?

1365
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:06,613
No, it was the chief
of police of Malibu,
a real reactionary.

1366
01:31:06,614 --> 01:31:08,343
So, your father...

1367
01:31:10,351 --> 01:31:13,353
- Oh, yeah, I get it.
Yeah. Yeah.
- What?

1368
01:31:13,354 --> 01:31:17,857
Oh, man.
My thinking about this case
has become very uptight.

1369
01:31:17,858 --> 01:31:19,425
Yeah.

1370
01:31:19,426 --> 01:31:20,792
Your father.

1371
01:31:21,762 --> 01:31:24,755
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

1372
01:31:26,768 --> 01:31:27,868
Jeffrey!

1373
01:31:27,869 --> 01:31:30,738
Walter, if you're there,
pick up the fucking phone,
man.

1374
01:31:30,739 --> 01:31:32,840
Come on, Walter.

1375
01:31:32,841 --> 01:31:36,143
- Pick it up, man.
This is an emergency.
- Dude? Dude?

1376
01:31:36,144 --> 01:31:40,181
Yeah. Listen, Walter.
I'm at my place. I need
you to come pick me up.

1377
01:31:40,182 --> 01:31:42,650
- I can't drive, Dude.
It's Erev shabbos.
- What?

1378
01:31:42,651 --> 01:31:44,151
- Erev shabbos.
- What?

1379
01:31:44,152 --> 01:31:47,388
- Erev shabbos. I can't drive.
- Man!

1380
01:31:47,389 --> 01:31:50,090
I'm not even supposed
to pick up the phone
unless it's an emergency.

1381
01:31:50,091 --> 01:31:53,561
- This is a fucking emergency!
- I understand.

1382
01:31:53,562 --> 01:31:55,229
That's why I picked up
the phone.

1383
01:31:55,230 --> 01:31:58,599
Walter, you fuck.
We gotta go to Pasadena, man.

1384
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,864
Come pick me up or I'm off
the fucking bowling team.

1385
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:18,953
Get out of that
fucking car, man!

1386
01:32:20,255 --> 01:32:22,390
Get out of that fucking car!

1387
01:32:22,391 --> 01:32:24,656
Get the fuck
out of the car, man.

1388
01:32:26,696 --> 01:32:28,664
Get out of the fucking...

1389
01:32:29,265 --> 01:32:31,166
Who the fuck
are you, man?
Easy, man!

1390
01:32:31,167 --> 01:32:32,566
Relax, man.

1391
01:32:33,636 --> 01:32:35,403
No physical harm intended.

1392
01:32:35,404 --> 01:32:38,239
Who the fuck are you?
Why you following me
around?

1393
01:32:38,240 --> 01:32:41,404
- Come on, fuckhead!
- Relax, man. I'm a brother shamus.

1394
01:32:42,411 --> 01:32:43,936
Brother Shamus?

1395
01:32:45,681 --> 01:32:47,449
Like an Irish monk?

1396
01:32:47,450 --> 01:32:49,417
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1397
01:32:49,418 --> 01:32:53,355
My name is Da Fino.
I'm a private snoop,
like you, man.

1398
01:32:54,657 --> 01:32:56,791
- What?
- A dick, man.

1399
01:32:56,792 --> 01:32:59,995
And let me tell you something,
I dig your work.

1400
01:32:59,996 --> 01:33:03,031
Playing one side
against the other,
in bed with everybody.

1401
01:33:03,032 --> 01:33:05,500
- Fabulous stuff, man.
- I'm not...

1402
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:08,503
Fuck it, man.
Just stay away from
my fucking lady friend.

1403
01:33:08,504 --> 01:33:11,139
Hey, I'm not messing
with your special lady.

1404
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:13,775
She's not my special lady.
She's my fucking lady friend.

1405
01:33:13,776 --> 01:33:16,611
- I'm just helping her
conceive, man!
- Hey, man. I'm not...

1406
01:33:16,612 --> 01:33:19,147
Who are you working for?
Lebowski?

1407
01:33:19,148 --> 01:33:20,582
Jackie Treehorn?

1408
01:33:22,386 --> 01:33:23,876
The Kneutsons.

1409
01:33:25,288 --> 01:33:27,990
Who the fuck are
the Kneutsons?

1410
01:33:27,991 --> 01:33:31,552
The Kneutsons,
it's a wandering
daughterjob.

1411
01:33:32,963 --> 01:33:35,598
Bunny Lebowski, man.

1412
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:38,467
Her real name
is Fawn Kneutson.

1413
01:33:38,468 --> 01:33:40,437
Her parents
want her back, see?

1414
01:33:41,605 --> 01:33:43,639
Jesus fucking Christ.

1415
01:33:43,640 --> 01:33:46,642
Crazy, huh?
Ran away about a year ago.

1416
01:33:46,643 --> 01:33:50,413
The Kneutsons told me
I should show her this
when I found her.

1417
01:33:50,414 --> 01:33:54,116
It's the family farm.
It's outside Moorhead,
Minnesota.

1418
01:33:54,117 --> 01:33:57,253
They think it'll
make her homesick.
Oh, boy.

1419
01:33:57,254 --> 01:33:58,988
How are you gonna keep them
down on the farm

1420
01:33:58,989 --> 01:34:00,957
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

1421
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:04,160
- She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.
- Oh, man.

1422
01:34:04,161 --> 01:34:05,428
Or I don't know.
Maybe not.

1423
01:34:05,429 --> 01:34:07,096
But she's definitely
not around.

1424
01:34:07,097 --> 01:34:11,034
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources,

1425
01:34:11,468 --> 01:34:13,402
trade information.

1426
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:15,201
Professional courtesy?

1427
01:34:15,772 --> 01:34:16,972
Compeers.
You know what I mean?

1428
01:34:16,973 --> 01:34:19,575
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

1429
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:21,812
And stay away
from my special...

1430
01:34:21,813 --> 01:34:24,714
From my fucking
lady friend, man!

1431
01:34:27,318 --> 01:34:29,218
The lingonberry pancake.

1432
01:34:32,123 --> 01:34:33,724
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1433
01:34:33,725 --> 01:34:35,852
Lingonberry pancakes.

1434
01:34:39,464 --> 01:34:41,295
Three pigs in blanket.

1435
01:34:42,266 --> 01:34:44,201
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

1436
01:34:47,372 --> 01:34:49,306
DIETER: She has
lingonberry pancakes.

1437
01:34:49,307 --> 01:34:51,503
(MEN SPEAKING GERMAN)

1438
01:34:57,982 --> 01:35:01,384
I mean, we totally
fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his payoff.

1439
01:35:01,385 --> 01:35:03,653
We got the kidnappers
all pissed off.

1440
01:35:03,654 --> 01:35:05,989
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

1441
01:35:05,990 --> 01:35:08,258
but he didn't do
anything, huh?

1442
01:35:08,259 --> 01:35:10,527
- Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic...
- No, no.

1443
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:12,929
I'm saying that
if he knows I'm a fuckup,

1444
01:35:12,930 --> 01:35:15,365
why does he leave me
in charge of getting
his wife back?

1445
01:35:15,366 --> 01:35:18,802
DUDE: Because he doesn't
fucking want her back, man.

1446
01:35:18,803 --> 01:35:22,073
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.
It's all a show.

1447
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:26,544
Okay, but then
why doesn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?

1448
01:35:26,545 --> 01:35:29,413
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

1449
01:35:29,414 --> 01:35:31,482
but he never asked
for it back.

1450
01:35:31,483 --> 01:35:34,578
The million bucks
was never in the briefcase.

1451
01:35:35,254 --> 01:35:38,356
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

1452
01:35:38,357 --> 01:35:41,125
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

1453
01:35:41,126 --> 01:35:43,761
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

1454
01:35:43,762 --> 01:35:47,565
Okay, but how does
all this add up to
an emergency?

1455
01:35:47,566 --> 01:35:51,869
I'm saying, I see what
you're getting at, Dude.
He kept the money.

1456
01:35:51,870 --> 01:35:53,805
My point is...

1457
01:35:53,806 --> 01:35:57,108
Here we are, it's shabbos,
the Sabbath,

1458
01:35:57,109 --> 01:36:01,212
which I'm allowed to break
only if it's a matter of
life or death.

1459
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:04,649
Will you come off it,
Walter? You're not even
fucking Jewish, man.

1460
01:36:04,650 --> 01:36:06,384
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1461
01:36:06,385 --> 01:36:07,852
Man, you're fucking
Polish Catholic!

1462
01:36:07,853 --> 01:36:09,554
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1463
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:11,756
I converted when
I married Cynthia.
Come on, Dude.

1464
01:36:11,757 --> 01:36:13,858
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You know this.

1465
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:16,194
And five fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

1466
01:36:16,195 --> 01:36:17,762
So what are you saying?
When you get divorced,

1467
01:36:17,763 --> 01:36:19,998
you turn in your library card?
You get a new license?

1468
01:36:19,999 --> 01:36:23,168
You stop being Jewish?
This is the driveway.

1469
01:36:23,169 --> 01:36:25,270
- Jewish as fucking Tevye.
- Man.

1470
01:36:25,271 --> 01:36:29,641
You know, it's all a part
of your sick Cynthia thing.

1471
01:36:29,642 --> 01:36:33,612
Man, taking care of her
fucking dog, going to her
fucking synagogue.

1472
01:36:33,613 --> 01:36:35,547
You're living in
the fucking past.

1473
01:36:35,548 --> 01:36:38,984
Three thousand years
of beautiful tradition,
from Moses to Sandy Koufax.

1474
01:36:38,985 --> 01:36:42,020
You're goddamn right I'm
living in the fucking past!

1475
01:36:42,021 --> 01:36:44,149
l've... Jesus.

1476
01:36:45,391 --> 01:36:47,326
WALTER:
What the hell happened?

1477
01:37:00,306 --> 01:37:02,297
Let's go. Fuck it.

1478
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:07,980
DUDE: Where was she, man?

1479
01:37:07,981 --> 01:37:10,048
Visiting friends of hers
in Palm Springs.

1480
01:37:10,049 --> 01:37:12,551
She just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

1481
01:37:12,552 --> 01:37:15,120
Well, I guess
the fucking nihilists
knew where she was.

1482
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:17,423
Jesus, Dude. She never
even kidnapped herself.

1483
01:37:17,424 --> 01:37:20,860
- Who is this gentleman, Dude?
- Who am l? I'm a fucking veteran.

1484
01:37:20,861 --> 01:37:22,161
- Come on!
- That's who I am.

1485
01:37:22,162 --> 01:37:24,688
You shouldn't go
in there, Dude.
He's very angry.

1486
01:37:27,034 --> 01:37:28,468
So, man.

1487
01:37:28,469 --> 01:37:32,372
So? She's back,
no thanks to you.

1488
01:37:32,373 --> 01:37:34,841
Where's the fucking money,
Lebowski?

1489
01:37:34,842 --> 01:37:38,244
A million bucks
from fucking, needy,
little Urban Achievers!

1490
01:37:38,245 --> 01:37:39,812
You are scum, man!

1491
01:37:39,813 --> 01:37:42,181
- Who the hell is he?
- Who am l? Who am l?

1492
01:37:42,182 --> 01:37:43,850
- Walter.
- I'm the guy that's gonna
kick your phony,

1493
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:45,251
...gold-bricking ass,
that's who I am.
- Man.

1494
01:37:45,252 --> 01:37:47,186
We know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

1495
01:37:47,187 --> 01:37:49,289
We know you kept
the million bucks
for yourself.

1496
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:50,957
You have your story,
I have mine.

1497
01:37:50,958 --> 01:37:54,327
I say I entrusted the money
to you and you stole it.

1498
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:57,630
As if we would
ever dream of taking
your bullshit money!

1499
01:37:57,631 --> 01:37:59,933
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

1500
01:37:59,934 --> 01:38:01,601
and you were
fucking glad, man.

1501
01:38:01,602 --> 01:38:03,937
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

1502
01:38:03,938 --> 01:38:07,307
All you needed was
a sap to pin it on.
You just met me.

1503
01:38:07,308 --> 01:38:10,310
You... You human paraquat.

1504
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:13,880
You figured,
"Oh, here's a loser,
you know, a deadbeat.

1505
01:38:13,881 --> 01:38:16,550
"Somebody this square
community won't give
a shit about."

1506
01:38:16,551 --> 01:38:18,110
Well, aren't you?

1507
01:38:19,387 --> 01:38:23,190
- Well, yeah, but...
- Get out, both of you.

1508
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:26,560
Look at that fucking phony,
Dude, pretending to be
a fucking millionaire.

1509
01:38:26,561 --> 01:38:28,929
Out of this house now,
you bums!

1510
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:30,597
Let me tell you
something else.

1511
01:38:30,598 --> 01:38:34,330
I've seen a lot of spinals,
Dude, and this guy's a fake.

1512
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:38,305
A fucking gold-bricker.
Stay away from me, mister!

1513
01:38:38,306 --> 01:38:40,040
This guy fucking walks.

1514
01:38:40,041 --> 01:38:42,476
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

1515
01:38:42,477 --> 01:38:43,744
You stay away from me!

1516
01:38:43,745 --> 01:38:46,246
Walter, for Christ's sake,
man! He's a cripple.

1517
01:38:46,247 --> 01:38:48,082
- I said! Get away from me!
- Come on. Come on.

1518
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:51,652
Walter, put him down, man!

1519
01:38:51,653 --> 01:38:55,389
Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude.
Walk! Achtung, baby!

1520
01:39:12,607 --> 01:39:15,703
Come on, man. Help me
put him back in his chair.

1521
01:39:19,648 --> 01:39:21,716
WALTER: At least
they had the fucking
decency to tell us

1522
01:39:21,717 --> 01:39:24,118
that we were fighting
the communists.

1523
01:39:26,622 --> 01:39:30,091
Whereas this
whole fucking thing,
this whole fucking thing

1524
01:39:30,092 --> 01:39:33,028
is nothing about nothing,
about oil,

1525
01:39:33,029 --> 01:39:35,463
which is what I personally
hear, Dude.

1526
01:39:35,464 --> 01:39:37,832
Sure you'll see
some tank battles,

1527
01:39:37,833 --> 01:39:41,360
but fighting in desert
is very different from
fighting in canopy jungle.

1528
01:39:42,438 --> 01:39:45,874
I mean, Nam was
a foot soldier's war,
whereas this thing should...

1529
01:39:46,842 --> 01:39:49,177
You know, should be
a piece of cake.

1530
01:39:49,178 --> 01:39:52,714
I mean, I had an M16, Jacko,
not an Abrams fucking tank.

1531
01:39:52,715 --> 01:39:56,184
- Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.
- Yeah.

1532
01:39:56,185 --> 01:39:58,586
That's fucking combat.

1533
01:39:58,587 --> 01:40:01,556
The man in the black
pajamas, Dude.

1534
01:40:01,557 --> 01:40:03,525
Worthy fucking adversary.

1535
01:40:03,526 --> 01:40:07,028
- Who's in pajamas, Walter?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1536
01:40:07,029 --> 01:40:09,330
Whereas what we have here,

1537
01:40:09,331 --> 01:40:11,566
a bunch of fig eaters
wearing towels on their head,

1538
01:40:11,567 --> 01:40:13,729
trying to find reverse
on a Soviet tank.

1539
01:40:14,604 --> 01:40:16,872
This is not a worthy
fucking adversary.
QUINTANA: Hey!

1540
01:40:16,873 --> 01:40:18,974
What's this
day-of-rest shit?

1541
01:40:18,975 --> 01:40:20,643
What's this bullshit?

1542
01:40:20,644 --> 01:40:23,779
I don't fucking care!
It don't matter to Jesus.

1543
01:40:23,780 --> 01:40:25,314
But you not fooling me,
man.

1544
01:40:25,315 --> 01:40:28,117
You might fool the fucks
in the league office

1545
01:40:28,118 --> 01:40:30,416
but you don't fool Jesus.

1546
01:40:30,587 --> 01:40:33,389
It's Bush league
psych-out stuff.

1547
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:34,789
Laughable, man!

1548
01:40:35,959 --> 01:40:39,054
I would've fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

1549
01:40:39,796 --> 01:40:42,732
I'll fuck you in the ass
next Wednesday instead.

1550
01:40:44,201 --> 01:40:46,635
You got a date
Wednesday, baby!

1551
01:40:51,508 --> 01:40:52,775
He's cracking.

1552
01:40:52,776 --> 01:40:54,577
...the whole concept of age.

1553
01:40:54,578 --> 01:40:56,846
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this

1554
01:40:56,847 --> 01:40:59,714
but in the 14th century,
the Rambam...

1555
01:41:09,726 --> 01:41:11,994
Well, they finally
did it.

1556
01:41:11,995 --> 01:41:14,231
They killed
my fucking car.

1557
01:41:14,232 --> 01:41:17,868
We want the money, Lebowski.

1558
01:41:17,869 --> 01:41:20,470
Ja. Otherwise,
we kill the girl.

1559
01:41:20,471 --> 01:41:24,074
Ja. It seems you have
forgotten our little deal, Lebowski.

1560
01:41:24,075 --> 01:41:26,910
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

1561
01:41:26,911 --> 01:41:29,212
We know you never did.

1562
01:41:29,213 --> 01:41:30,881
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

1563
01:41:30,882 --> 01:41:32,682
No, Donny.
These men are nihilists.

1564
01:41:32,683 --> 01:41:34,117
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1565
01:41:35,786 --> 01:41:36,953
We don't care.

1566
01:41:36,954 --> 01:41:41,491
We still want the money,
Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

1567
01:41:41,492 --> 01:41:44,227
- Fuck you.
Fuck the three of you.
- Cool it, Walter.

1568
01:41:44,228 --> 01:41:48,165
No. Without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

1569
01:41:48,166 --> 01:41:51,601
That's what ransom is.
Those are the fucking rules.

1570
01:41:51,602 --> 01:41:54,004
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

1571
01:41:54,005 --> 01:41:56,406
She thought we could
get $1 million.

1572
01:41:56,407 --> 01:41:59,009
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

1573
01:41:59,010 --> 01:42:02,712
Who's the fucking nihilists
around here, you bunch
of fucking crybabies?

1574
01:42:02,713 --> 01:42:05,182
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal.

1575
01:42:05,183 --> 01:42:06,983
DUDE: There never
was any money.

1576
01:42:06,984 --> 01:42:09,186
The big Lebowski gave me
an empty briefcase,

1577
01:42:09,187 --> 01:42:11,321
so take it up with him, man.

1578
01:42:11,322 --> 01:42:13,925
And I would like
my undies back.

1579
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:15,226
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

1580
01:42:15,227 --> 01:42:17,795
No, Donny.
These men are cowards.

1581
01:42:17,796 --> 01:42:19,163
Okay!

1582
01:42:19,164 --> 01:42:22,691
So we takes the money
you have on you, and
we calls it even.

1583
01:42:24,136 --> 01:42:26,237
- Fuck you.
- Hey, no. Come on, Walter.

1584
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:28,339
Come on, we're ending
this thing cheap, man.

1585
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:31,008
- No. What's mine is mine.
- No, come on, Walter.

1586
01:42:31,009 --> 01:42:33,311
- No funny stuff.
- All right. All right.

1587
01:42:33,312 --> 01:42:38,149
- No funny stuff.
- I got 4 bucks, almost 5.

1588
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:40,785
- I got $18.
WALTER: What's mine is mine.

1589
01:42:40,786 --> 01:42:43,915
We fuck you up, man!
We takes the money!

1590
01:42:44,456 --> 01:42:45,821
Come and get it.

1591
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:51,462
- We fuck you up!
- Show me what you got,
nihilists.

1592
01:42:51,463 --> 01:42:54,031
- I fuck you!
- Walter, come on.
He's got a sword.

1593
01:42:54,032 --> 01:42:56,300
Fucking dipshit with
a nine-toed woman!

1594
01:42:56,301 --> 01:43:00,170
I fuck you! Fuck you!
I fuck you!

1595
01:43:06,345 --> 01:43:08,079
- Take it easy, man.
- I fuck you!

1596
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,081
- Take the $4.
- I fuck you!

1597
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,454
I fuck you!

1598
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:17,355
I'm gonna hit you with
the fucking ball, man.

1599
01:43:22,095 --> 01:43:24,222
MAN: Hey, dickhead!
- Anti-Semite.

1600
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:27,966
I fuck you in the ass!
I fuck you in the ass!

1601
01:43:27,967 --> 01:43:31,203
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1602
01:43:31,204 --> 01:43:33,195
I fuck you! I fuck you!

1603
01:43:39,445 --> 01:43:41,414
We got a man down, Dude!

1604
01:43:45,118 --> 01:43:46,418
Oh, God. They shot him, man.

1605
01:43:46,419 --> 01:43:48,754
- He's not shot. No, Dude.
- Are you shot, Donny?

1606
01:43:48,755 --> 01:43:51,123
- There weren't
any shots fired.
- Huh?

1607
01:43:51,124 --> 01:43:54,355
It's a heart attack.
Call the medics, Dude.

1608
01:43:54,927 --> 01:43:57,829
I'd go myself,
but I'm pumping blood,
might pass out.

1609
01:43:57,830 --> 01:44:01,233
Rest easy, good buddy.
You're doing fine.

1610
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:03,635
We got help choppering in.

1611
01:44:31,165 --> 01:44:32,932
Hello, gentlemen.

1612
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:35,163
- You are the bereaved?
- Yeah, man.

1613
01:44:35,836 --> 01:44:38,571
Francis Donnelly,
pleased to meet you.

1614
01:44:38,572 --> 01:44:40,974
- Jeff Lebowski.
- Walter Sobchak.

1615
01:44:40,975 --> 01:44:43,205
The Dude actually is...

1616
01:44:44,244 --> 01:44:46,179
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

1617
01:44:48,015 --> 01:44:52,752
Yes. I understand
you're taking away
the remains?

1618
01:44:52,753 --> 01:44:53,948
Yeah.

1619
01:44:54,688 --> 01:44:56,486
We have the urn.

1620
01:44:57,858 --> 01:45:00,054
I assume this is credit card?

1621
01:45:01,261 --> 01:45:02,354
Yeah.

1622
01:45:17,078 --> 01:45:18,478
What's this?

1623
01:45:19,247 --> 01:45:20,981
Now, that's for the urn.

1624
01:45:20,982 --> 01:45:23,007
Don't need it.
We're scattering the ashes.

1625
01:45:23,785 --> 01:45:26,520
Yes. So we were informed.

1626
01:45:26,521 --> 01:45:30,324
However, we must, of course,
transmit the remains to you

1627
01:45:30,325 --> 01:45:31,918
in a receptacle.

1628
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:34,959
That's $180.

1629
01:45:35,296 --> 01:45:39,233
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1630
01:45:39,567 --> 01:45:41,802
- Well, can't we just...
- $180?

1631
01:45:41,803 --> 01:45:43,794
They range up to $3,000.

1632
01:45:44,606 --> 01:45:47,808
- We're...
- Can't we just rent it
from you, you know?

1633
01:45:47,809 --> 01:45:50,744
Sir, this is a mortuary
not a rental house.

1634
01:45:50,745 --> 01:45:53,147
- We're scattering
the fucking ashes!
- Walter, Walter.

1635
01:45:53,148 --> 01:45:55,749
Just because we're bereaved
doesn't make us saps.

1636
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:58,218
Sir, please lower
your voices.

1637
01:45:58,219 --> 01:46:02,389
Man, don't you have,
you know, something else
we can put him in?

1638
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:03,490
You know?

1639
01:46:03,491 --> 01:46:06,552
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

1640
01:46:06,828 --> 01:46:08,421
God damn it!

1641
01:46:10,566 --> 01:46:12,227
Is there a Ralph's
around here?

1642
01:46:39,228 --> 01:46:41,890
Donny was a good bowler
and a good man.

1643
01:46:43,165 --> 01:46:45,366
He was one of us.

1644
01:46:45,367 --> 01:46:49,304
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

1645
01:46:49,438 --> 01:46:53,241
And as a surfer
he explored the beaches
of Southern California

1646
01:46:53,242 --> 01:46:56,144
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

1647
01:46:56,145 --> 01:46:58,705
and up to Pismo.

1648
01:46:59,515 --> 01:47:00,778
He died...

1649
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:05,954
He died as so many young men
of his generation,
before his time.

1650
01:47:05,955 --> 01:47:09,225
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him,

1651
01:47:09,226 --> 01:47:12,628
as you took so many bright,
flowering young men

1652
01:47:12,629 --> 01:47:15,531
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1653
01:47:15,532 --> 01:47:17,261
at Hill 364.

1654
01:47:18,568 --> 01:47:20,935
These young men
gave their lives,

1655
01:47:21,538 --> 01:47:23,006
and so did Donny.

1656
01:47:25,142 --> 01:47:27,133
Donny, who loved bowling.

1657
01:47:30,180 --> 01:47:31,170
And so,

1658
01:47:32,816 --> 01:47:35,182
Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

1659
01:47:36,486 --> 01:47:41,583
in accordance with
what we think your dying
wishes might well have been,

1660
01:47:42,926 --> 01:47:45,725
we commit your final
mortal remains

1661
01:47:46,630 --> 01:47:49,030
to the bosom of
the Pacific Ocean

1662
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,469
which you loved so well.

1663
01:47:54,804 --> 01:47:56,898
Good night, sweet prince.

1664
01:48:12,056 --> 01:48:13,456
Shit.

1665
01:48:15,393 --> 01:48:17,418
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1666
01:48:19,230 --> 01:48:22,432
- Goddamn wind.
- Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1667
01:48:22,433 --> 01:48:24,801
- You fucking asshole!
- Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1668
01:48:24,802 --> 01:48:27,103
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man!

1669
01:48:27,104 --> 01:48:28,772
- I'm sorry.
- It was an accident.

1670
01:48:28,773 --> 01:48:31,341
- What was that shit about Vietnam?
- Dude, I'm sorry.

1671
01:48:31,342 --> 01:48:33,743
What the fuck does anything have to do with Vietnam?

1672
01:48:33,744 --> 01:48:35,812
- Dude, I'm sorry.
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

1673
01:48:35,813 --> 01:48:37,406
Dude, I'm sorry.

1674
01:48:40,318 --> 01:48:41,546
Fucking...

1675
01:48:48,526 --> 01:48:49,994
Fuck, Walter.

1676
01:48:51,896 --> 01:48:53,386
Come on, Dude.

1677
01:48:54,231 --> 01:48:55,893
Hey, fuck it, man.

1678
01:48:59,804 --> 01:49:01,431
Let's go bowling.

1679
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:59,030
- Two oat sodas, Gary.
- Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1680
01:49:59,031 --> 01:50:02,566
- Yeah, thanks, man.
- I was sorry to hear about Donny.

1681
01:50:02,567 --> 01:50:05,435
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1682
01:50:06,272 --> 01:50:10,342
sometimes you eat the bear,
and sometimes, you know...

1683
01:50:10,343 --> 01:50:11,606
Hey, man.

1684
01:50:12,412 --> 01:50:15,681
- How do you do, Dude?
- I wondered if
I'd see you again.

1685
01:50:15,682 --> 01:50:17,816
I wouldn't miss
the semis.

1686
01:50:17,817 --> 01:50:19,518
- Oh, yeah?
- How's things been going?

1687
01:50:19,519 --> 01:50:22,721
Well, you know,
strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

1688
01:50:22,722 --> 01:50:25,418
- Sure. I got you.
- Yeah.

1689
01:50:26,993 --> 01:50:28,093
Thanks, Gary.

1690
01:50:28,094 --> 01:50:30,529
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

1691
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:33,665
- Sure. Take it easy, Dude.
- Oh, yeah.

1692
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,834
I know that you will.

1693
01:50:35,835 --> 01:50:39,169
Yeah. Well,
the Dude abides.

1694
01:50:43,176 --> 01:50:44,370
Walter.

1695
01:50:46,079 --> 01:50:48,047
The Dude abides.

1696
01:50:51,951 --> 01:50:55,285
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1697
01:50:56,589 --> 01:50:58,890
It's good knowing
he's out there,

1698
01:50:58,891 --> 01:51:02,953
the Dude, taking her easy
for all us sinners.

1699
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,861
I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1700
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:11,671
Well, that about does her.

1701
01:51:11,672 --> 01:51:13,162
Wraps her all up.

1702
01:51:14,775 --> 01:51:18,234
Things seem to have
worked out pretty good
for the Dude and Walter.

1703
01:51:18,912 --> 01:51:22,178
And it was
a pretty good story,
don't you think?

1704
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:25,382
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

1705
01:51:26,019 --> 01:51:27,487
Parts anyway.

1706
01:51:29,056 --> 01:51:31,218
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1707
01:51:32,326 --> 01:51:37,355
But then I happen to know that there's
a little Lebowski on the way.

1708
01:51:39,032 --> 01:51:42,366
I guess that's the way the whole
darned human comedy keeps

1709
01:51:42,936 --> 01:51:45,338
perpetuating itself

1710
01:51:45,339 --> 01:51:47,501
down through the generations.

1711
01:51:48,008 --> 01:51:52,275
Westward the wagons,
across the sands of time
until we...

1712
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:56,677
Oh, look at me.
I'm rambling again.

1713
01:51:58,085 --> 01:52:00,577
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1714
01:52:01,054 --> 01:52:03,387
Catch you later on
down the trail.

1715
01:52:04,592 --> 01:52:07,687
Say, friend, you got any more
of that good sarsaparilla?
