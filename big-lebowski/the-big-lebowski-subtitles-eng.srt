1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,378
Another Caucasian, Gary.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,795
Right, Dude.

3
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:10,175
Friends like these,
huh, Gary?

4
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:12,092
That's right, Dude.

5
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:36,576
Do you have
A good sarsaparilla?

6
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:38,869
Bartender:
Sioux city sarsaparilla?

7
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,413
Yeah. That’s a good one.

8
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:45,543
How you doin'
there, Dude?

9
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:47,961
Not too good, man.

10
00:00:48,003 --> 00:00:49,962
One of those days, huh?

11
00:00:50,005 --> 00:00:51,840
Yeah.

12
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:52,759
Well...

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,679
A wiser fella than myself
once said,

14
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:59,556
"Sometimes you eat
the bar and--"

15
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,557
Much obliged.

16
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:04,853
"And sometimes
the bar, well...

17
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:06,270
He eats you."

18
00:01:06,313 --> 00:01:09,567
Hmm. That some kind
of eastern thing?

19
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:11,610
Far from it.

20
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:20,244
I like your style,
Dude.

21
00:01:20,286 --> 00:01:22,163
Hmm. Well...

22
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:24,541
I dig your style, too,
man.

23
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:27,500
You got
a whole cowboy thing going.

24
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:32,172
Thankie.

25
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:34,675
There's just one thing,
Dude.

26
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:36,052
And what's that?

27
00:01:36,094 --> 00:01:39,596
Do you have to use
so many cuss words?

28
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:43,893
What the fuck
are you talking about?

29
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:46,644
Ok, Dude,

30
00:01:46,688 --> 00:01:49,565
Have it your way.

31
00:01:49,606 --> 00:01:52,443
Take her easy, Dude.

32
00:01:52,485 --> 00:01:54,987
Yeah. Thanks, man.

33
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:01,619
Call for you, Dude.

34
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:05,873
Hello?

35
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:08,668
Maude: Jeffrey, you have
not gone to the doctor.

36
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,545
Uh, oh, yeah.
no--no, I haven't yet.

37
00:02:11,586 --> 00:02:12,547
Uh--

38
00:02:12,587 --> 00:02:15,048
I'd like to see you
immediately.

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,302
Oh?

40
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,440
So you're Lebowski.

41
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:31,983
Yeah.

42
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,278
Maude has told me
all about you.

43
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,279
She'll be back
in a minute. Sit down.

44
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:40,074
Do you want a drink?

45
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:42,451
Yeah, sure.
White Russian.

46
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,496
The bar's over there.

47
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:51,543
So what do you do,
Lebowski?

48
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:53,505
Who the fuck are you,
man?

49
00:02:54,505 --> 00:02:56,340
Just a friend
of Maudie's.

50
00:02:56,382 --> 00:02:58,300
Yeah, the friend
with the cleft asshole?

51
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:02,679
What do you do?

52
00:03:02,721 --> 00:03:04,556
Oh, nothing much.

53
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,057
Maude: Hello, Jeffrey.

54
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:06,976
Hello.

55
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:08,353
Yeah, how are you?
Um...

56
00:03:08,394 --> 00:03:09,269
Listen, Maude,

57
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:12,315
I got to, uh...

58
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,568
Tender my resignation
or whatever,

59
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,947
Because, uh...it
looks like your mother

60
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:20,864
really was kidnapped
after all.

61
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,741
She most certainly
was not.

62
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:26,663
Hey, man, why
don't you fucking...

63
00:03:26,704 --> 00:03:28,081
Listen occasionally?

64
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,039
You might
learn something.

65
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,958
Now, I got--

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,500
Please don't call her
my mother.

67
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,753
She's most definitely
the perpetrator

68
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:36,255
and not the victim.

69
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:39,175
I'm telling you, I got
pretty definitive evidence--

70
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,050
From who?

71
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:41,552
From the main guy--
Oolie.

72
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:42,971
Oolie Coco?

73
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:44,847
Her co-star in
the beaver picture?

74
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,641
Beaver?
you mean vagina--

75
00:03:47,682 --> 00:03:50,061
I mean,
you know the guy?

76
00:03:50,103 --> 00:03:51,980
I might have introduced them
for all I know.

77
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,940
Do you remember Oolie?

78
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:54,858
Hmm.

79
00:03:54,898 --> 00:03:57,277
He's a musician. Used
to have a group--Autobahn.

80
00:03:57,317 --> 00:03:58,777
Look in my LP's.

81
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,654
They released one album
in the late seventies.

82
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:04,576
Their music is sort of
a--ugh--technopop.

83
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,952
So he's pretending to be
the abductor?

84
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:07,871
Well, yeah.

85
00:04:07,911 --> 00:04:10,748
Look, Jeffrey, you don't
really kidnap someone

86
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:11,750
you're acquainted with.

87
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:12,541
The whole idea

88
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,043
is that the hostage can't
be able to identify you

89
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,545
after you've let them go.

90
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:17,005
I know that.

91
00:04:20,382 --> 00:04:22,760
What the fuck
is with this guy?

92
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,262
Who is he?

93
00:04:24,304 --> 00:04:25,179
Knox Harrington.

94
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:26,597
The video artist.

95
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:29,476
So Oolie
has the money?

96
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:30,851
Well...

97
00:04:30,893 --> 00:04:33,269
Uh, no, not exactly.

98
00:04:33,313 --> 00:04:34,270
Uh...

99
00:04:34,313 --> 00:04:36,815
This is a very
complicated case, Maude.

100
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:38,567
A lot of ins,
a lot of outs,

101
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,945
a lot of what-have-yous,
and, uh,

102
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,864
a lot of, uh, strands
to keep in my head, man.

103
00:04:42,904 --> 00:04:44,865
A lot of strands
in old Duder's head.

104
00:04:44,907 --> 00:04:45,740
Hello?

105
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:47,241
If Oolie doesn't have it,
then who does?

106
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:50,079
Ha ha ha ha! It's Sandra,
about the Bearnali.

107
00:04:50,121 --> 00:04:51,581
Uh, look,
I have to take this.

108
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,458
Do you still have
that doctor's number?

109
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,375
Oh. No, really. It's
not even bruised anymore.

110
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:56,878
Oh, please, Jeffrey,

111
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,753
I don't want
to be responsible

112
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:59,797
For any delayed
after-effects.

113
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:02,175
After-effects?

114
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,219
Maude: See, see.

115
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:08,014
Ha ha ha ha ha!

116
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,163
Could you slide
your shorts down,

117
00:05:33,206 --> 00:05:34,873
Mr. Lebowski, please?

118
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:36,543
Hmm?

119
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,460
No. No, man.
She hit me right here.

120
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:39,961
I understand.

121
00:05:40,003 --> 00:05:42,507
Could you slide
your shorts down, please?

122
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:55,061
# Just got home
from Illinois #

123
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,480
# Lock the front door,
oh, boy #

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,150
# Got to sit down,
take a rest on the porch #

125
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:03,570
# Imagination sets in #

126
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,947
# Pretty soon I’m singin' #

127
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:07,449
# Doo doo doo #

128
00:06:07,489 --> 00:06:09,866
# Lookin' out my back door #

129
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,244
# There's a giant
doing cartwheels #

130
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,663
# A statue
wearin' high heels #

131
00:06:14,706 --> 00:06:17,041
# Look at all
the happy creatures #

132
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,960
# Dancin' on the lawn #

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,961
# A dinosaur Victrola #

134
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:23,757
# Listenin' to Buck Owens #

135
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,257
# Doo doo doo #

136
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,175
# Lookin' out my back door #

137
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,469
Ow! Ooh! Ooh!

138
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:31,514
# Tambourines and elephants
are playing in the band #

139
00:06:34,807 --> 00:06:36,268
# Wondrous apparition #

140
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:39,063
# Provided by magician #

141
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:40,565
# Doo doo doo #

142
00:06:40,606 --> 00:06:43,610
# Lookin' out my back door #

143
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,545
# Tambourines
and elephants #

144
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,962
# Are playing in the band #

145
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:08,342
# Won't you take a ride
on the flyin' spoon? #

146
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:09,844
# Doo doo doo #

147
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,679
# Bother me tomorrow #

148
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:14,139
# Today I’ll buy
no sorrows #

149
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:16,057
# Doo doo doo #

150
00:07:16,101 --> 00:07:19,186
# Lookin' out my back door #

151
00:08:07,902 --> 00:08:09,362
He lives
in north Hollywood,

152
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:11,779
on Radford, near
the in-n-out burger.

153
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,157
The in-n-out burger's
on Camrose.

154
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,576
Near
the in-n-out burger.

155
00:08:14,615 --> 00:08:16,452
Those are good burgers,
Walter.

156
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:17,871
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

157
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:18,871
The kid is in
ninth grade, Dude,

158
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:21,750
And his father is--
Are you ready for this?

159
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,250
His father is
Arthur Digby Sellers.

160
00:08:24,293 --> 00:08:26,170
Who the fuck is that?

161
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,172
Huh?

162
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:28,965
Who the fuck is
Arthur Digby Sellers?

163
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:31,842
Ever heard of a little show
called branded, Dude?

164
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:32,760
Yes, I know--

165
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:34,762
All but one man died
there at bitter creek?

166
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,639
I know the fucking show,
Walter. So what?

167
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:40,351
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers
wrote 156 episodes, Dude.

168
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:41,351
Huh.

169
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:42,769
The bulk
of the series.

170
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:43,770
Oh.

171
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,148
Not exactly
a lightweight.

172
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,148
No.

173
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,567
And yet his son
is a fucking dunce.

174
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,070
Heh.

175
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,864
Anyway, we'll go there
after the what-have-you,

176
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:54,449
we'll brace the kid,
should be a pushover.

177
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,865
We'll be near
the in-n-out burger.

178
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:58,744
Shut the fuck up,
Donny!

179
00:08:58,786 --> 00:09:00,663
We'll go out there,
we'll brace the kid,

180
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:02,664
He should be a pushover.

181
00:09:02,706 --> 00:09:04,541
We'll get that fucking
$1 million back--

182
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,960
If he hasn't spent it
already.

183
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,253
A million fucking clams.

184
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:10,672
And yes, we'll be near
the, uh...

185
00:09:10,715 --> 00:09:12,175
In-n-out.

186
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,050
Hey, shh! Shh!

187
00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:14,052
Some burgers,

188
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,052
some beers,

189
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,012
a few laughs.

190
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:21,393
Our fucking troubles
are over, Dude.

191
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:35,154
Oh, fuck me, man!

192
00:09:35,197 --> 00:09:38,451
That kid's already spent
all the money, man!

193
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,952
New 'vette?
Hardly, Dude.

194
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:44,748
I'd say he still has
960, $970,000 left,

195
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,668
depending on the options.

196
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,710
Wait in the car, Donny.

197
00:09:50,797 --> 00:09:51,672
Woman: Yes?

198
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:53,090
Pilar?

199
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:55,969
My name
is Walter Sobchak.

200
00:09:56,009 --> 00:09:58,846
This is my associate
Jeffrey Lebowski.

201
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,141
Um, we came to talk
about little Larry.

202
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:02,641
May we come in?

203
00:10:02,682 --> 00:10:04,058
Pilar: Yes, yes.

204
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:05,018
Thank you.

205
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,983
That's him, Dude.

206
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:20,576
And a good day to you,
Sir!

207
00:10:20,616 --> 00:10:23,121
Uh, sit down, please.

208
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,545
Larry, sweetie,
that man is here!

209
00:10:30,586 --> 00:10:31,961
Is he...

210
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,465
Does he still write?

211
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:34,840
Oh, no, no.

212
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:36,759
He has health problems.

213
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,802
Uh-huh.

214
00:10:39,219 --> 00:10:41,556
Uh, sir, I just
want to say, uh...

215
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,057
That we're both,

216
00:10:43,099 --> 00:10:45,058
on a personal level...

217
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:47,978
Really enormous fans.

218
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,273
Branded, especially
the early episodes,

219
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:53,275
was truly a source
of inspiration--

220
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,568
Pilar:
Sweetie, sit down!

221
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,570
Uh, this man
is the police.

222
00:10:55,612 --> 00:10:56,570
Oh, no, ma'am,

223
00:10:56,612 --> 00:10:57,947
we didn't want
to give the impression

224
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:58,947
that we were police
exactly.

225
00:10:58,989 --> 00:11:00,865
We're hoping
it won't be necessary

226
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:01,741
to call the police.

227
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:04,661
But that's up
to little Larry here.

228
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:06,121
Isn't it, Larry?

229
00:11:16,298 --> 00:11:18,717
Is this your homework,
Larry?

230
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,471
Is this your homework,
Larry?

231
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:22,346
Look, man--

232
00:11:22,387 --> 00:11:23,347
Dude, please.

233
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:25,266
Is this your homework,
Larry?

234
00:11:25,307 --> 00:11:27,143
Just ask him
about the car, man.

235
00:11:27,183 --> 00:11:28,143
Is this yours, Larry?

236
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:29,561
Is this your homework,
Larry?

237
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:31,063
Is that your car
out front?

238
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:31,940
Is this your homework,
Larry?

239
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,440
We know it's
his fucking homework!

240
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,860
Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

241
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,777
Look, Larry...

242
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,778
Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

243
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,657
You're entering
a world of pain, son.

244
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:42,158
we know that this is
your homework.

245
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:43,576
We know that you stole
the car.

246
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:44,952
And the fucking money!

247
00:11:44,993 --> 00:11:46,452
And the fucking money.

248
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:47,872
And we know that this
is your homework.

249
00:11:47,912 --> 00:11:49,247
We're gonna cut
your dick off, Larry.

250
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,792
You're killing
your father, Larry.

251
00:11:53,586 --> 00:11:54,961
All right.

252
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:56,462
This is pointless.

253
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:57,841
Ok?

254
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,801
It's time for plan "b."

255
00:12:01,801 --> 00:12:05,555
You might want to watch out
that front window, Larry.

256
00:12:05,597 --> 00:12:07,559
Son, this is what happens

257
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,019
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass!

258
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,854
Little language problem
here.

259
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:16,149
The little prick's
stonewalling me.

260
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,068
Walter!

261
00:12:18,109 --> 00:12:19,988
What--what are you doing,
man?

262
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,408
What are you doing?

263
00:12:25,283 --> 00:12:26,743
Here you go, Larry.

264
00:12:26,786 --> 00:12:29,078
You see what happens?

265
00:12:29,122 --> 00:12:31,957
You see what happens,
Larry?

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,960
You see what happens?

267
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:35,377
This is what happens

268
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,296
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass, Larry!

269
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:41,676
This is what happens,
Larry!

270
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,470
You see what happens,
Larry?

271
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,970
You see what happens

272
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,345
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

273
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:47,765
This is what happens.

274
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:49,809
You see what happens,
Larry?

275
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:51,644
You see what happens,
Larry?

276
00:12:51,685 --> 00:12:54,064
Do you see what happens,
Larry,

277
00:12:54,104 --> 00:12:56,608
when you fuck a stranger
in the ass?

278
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:01,278
This is what happens,
Larry!

279
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:02,278
Man: No!

280
00:13:02,322 --> 00:13:03,654
This is what happens,
Larry!

281
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:04,657
This is what happens

282
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:06,076
when you fuck a stranger--

283
00:13:06,117 --> 00:13:07,577
What the fuck
are you doing, man?!

284
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:08,452
Stop it!

285
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,747
I just bought
that fucking car last week!

286
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:11,747
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

287
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,166
I'm gonna
fuckin' kill you!

288
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,042
I just bought
the fucking car last week!

289
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,461
I’ll kill your
fucking car, man!

290
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,465
No! No! Hey! Hey!
That's not his--hey!

291
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:21,841
God damn it!

292
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:23,259
No! Oh, no!

293
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:24,760
Man: Fuck you!

294
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:26,179
You like that?

295
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,680
Fuck you!

296
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,185
I kill your fucking car!

297
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,039
I accept your apology.

298
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,960
No. I just--I just

299
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,877
Want to handle it
by myself from now on.

300
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:01,756
No, no, no.

301
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:05,051
That has nothing
to do with it.

302
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,970
Yes, the car made it home.

303
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,345
You're calling me at home.

304
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,849
No, Walter,

305
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,268
it did not look like...

306
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:15,644
Larry was about to crack.

307
00:14:15,685 --> 00:14:18,604
Well,
that's your perception.

308
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:22,359
You know, Walter,
you're right.

309
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:24,778
There is
an unspoken message here.

310
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:25,778
It's fuck you!

311
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,782
Leave me the fuck alone!

312
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:32,618
Yeah, I’ll be at practice.

313
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:50,261
Pin your diapers on,
Lebowski.

314
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,140
Jackie Treehorn
wants to see you.

315
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,560
Jackie Treehorn knows
which Lebowski you are.

316
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,854
Jackie Treehorn wants to see
the deadbeat Lebowski.

317
00:14:57,894 --> 00:15:00,481
You're not dealing
with morons here.

318
00:15:45,484 --> 00:15:46,943
Hello, Dude.

319
00:15:46,984 --> 00:15:48,363
Thanks for coming.

320
00:15:48,403 --> 00:15:50,279
I'm Jackie Treehorn.

321
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,577
This is quite a pad
you got here, man.

322
00:15:55,618 --> 00:15:57,453
Completely unspoiled.

323
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,457
What's your drink, Dude?

324
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:01,376
White Russian.
Thanks.

325
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,545
White Russian.

326
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:05,671
How's the smut business,
Jackie?

327
00:16:05,711 --> 00:16:07,548
I wouldn't know,
Dude.

328
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,551
I deal in publishing,

329
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:10,466
entertainment,

330
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:12,554
political advocacy.

331
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:13,970
Oh. Which one's
Logjamming?

332
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,849
Yes, regrettably,
it's true.

333
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:18,643
Standards have fallen
in adult entertainment.

334
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:20,060
It's video, Dude.

335
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,564
Now that we're competing
with those amateurs,

336
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:26,359
We can't afford to invest
in little extras, like story,

337
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,278
production value,

338
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,653
feelings.

339
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:33,073
You know, people forget

340
00:16:33,115 --> 00:16:37,452
that the brain is
the biggest erogenous zone.

341
00:16:37,493 --> 00:16:38,872
On you maybe.

342
00:16:38,912 --> 00:16:40,747
Of course, you have to take
the good with the bad.

343
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:43,542
New technology permits us
to do very exciting things

344
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,961
In interactive
erotic software.

345
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,462
Wave of the future,
Dude.

346
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:50,759
100% electronic.

347
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,260
Hmm. Well...

348
00:16:52,301 --> 00:16:54,804
I still jerk off
manually.

349
00:16:56,095 --> 00:16:57,055
Of course you do.

350
00:16:57,097 --> 00:16:58,475
I can see you're anxious

351
00:16:58,515 --> 00:16:59,975
for me to get to the point.

352
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:02,353
Well, here it is, Dude.

353
00:17:02,394 --> 00:17:04,270
Where's Bunny?

354
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,149
Well, I thought you
might know that, man.

355
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:07,649
Why would I?

356
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,068
She only ran off

357
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:11,362
to get away from that
rather sizable debt to me.

358
00:17:11,403 --> 00:17:13,738
No. She didn't run off.
She's been, um--

359
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,658
I've heard that kidnapping
story, so save it.

360
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:18,577
I know you're mixed up
in all this, Dude,

361
00:17:18,618 --> 00:17:21,956
And I don't care what you're
trying to get from the husband.

362
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,372
That's your business.

363
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,877
All I’m saying is...

364
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,377
I want mine.

365
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,755
Yeah, right, man.

366
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:30,756
I mean, there are
a lot of, um,

367
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,719
Facets to this, a lot
of interested parties.

368
00:17:35,595 --> 00:17:37,011
Excuse me.

369
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:42,600
Yeah?

370
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:45,063
Oh, yeah.

371
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:46,020
Where's that?

372
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,818
All right.

373
00:17:54,697 --> 00:17:55,613
Excuse me.

374
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,600
Oh.

375
00:18:29,689 --> 00:18:31,067
Forgive me.

376
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,443
No problemo, man.

377
00:18:33,484 --> 00:18:34,863
So, uh...

378
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:39,158
If I, uh, can find
your money...

379
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:42,077
Uh, what's in it
for The Dude?

380
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:43,578
Well, of course,
there's that to discuss.

381
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,164
Uh, refill?

382
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:46,666
Yeah. The pope
shit in the woods?

383
00:18:46,707 --> 00:18:48,042
10% finder's fee.

384
00:18:48,082 --> 00:18:49,042
That all right?

385
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:49,961
Mmm. Ok.

386
00:18:50,002 --> 00:18:50,961
Done, Jackie.

387
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:54,340
Yeah. I dig the way
you do business, man.

388
00:18:54,381 --> 00:18:55,759
Your money
is being held

389
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,051
By a kid named
Larry Sellers.

390
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,470
He lives
in north Hollywood,

391
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,970
On Radford, uh...

392
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,975
By the
in-n-out burger.

393
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:06,853
A fuckin' brat,
but I’m sure your goons

394
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:10,648
Can get it off him.
I mean, he's 15.

395
00:19:10,689 --> 00:19:13,693
Flunking social studies.

396
00:19:16,988 --> 00:19:19,363
So, if you could just,
uh...

397
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:23,161
Write me a check for my
10% of half a million...

398
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,453
5 grand...

399
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,914
I’ll go out and mingle--

400
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,711
You mix a hell
of a Caucasian, Jackie.

401
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:37,050
A 15-year-old kid.

402
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:40,845
Is this
some sort of a joke?

403
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,345
No, no joke.

404
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:46,140
No funny stuff, Jackie.
the kid's got it.

405
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:47,685
Hi, fellas.

406
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:52,106
The kid just wanted
a car.

407
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:58,569
All The Dude ever wanted
was his rug back.

408
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,113
I'm not greedy.

409
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:04,368
It would really...

410
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,912
Tie the room together.

411
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:11,042
The stranger:
Darkness washed over The Dude.

412
00:20:11,082 --> 00:20:13,961
Darker than
a black steer's took us

413
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:16,840
On a moonless prairie night.

414
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:20,301
There was no bottom.

415
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,439
# Yeah, yeah #

416
00:20:34,481 --> 00:20:35,859
# Oh, yeah #

417
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:39,403
# What condition
 my condition was in #

418
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:44,073
# I woke up this morning
with the sun down #

419
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,618
# Shinin' in him #

420
00:20:48,787 --> 00:20:53,542
# I found my mind
in a brown paper bag #

421
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,586
# But then #

422
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,759
# I tripped on a cloud
and fell 8 miles high #

423
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,761
# I tore my mind
on a jagged sky #

424
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,140
# I just dropped in #

425
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,478
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

426
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,770
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

427
00:21:13,813 --> 00:21:16,689
# What condition
my condition was in #

428
00:21:22,988 --> 00:21:26,658
# I pushed my soul
in a deep dark hole #

429
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:29,202
# And then
I followed it in #

430
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,957
# I watched myself
crawlin' out #

431
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,377
# As I was crawlin' in #

432
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,171
# I got up so tight #

433
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:42,550
# I couldn't unwind #

434
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:44,469
# I saw so much #

435
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,845
# I broke my mind #

436
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,765
# I just dropped in #

437
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:52,810
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

438
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,778
# Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah #

439
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:07,283
# What condition
my condition was in #

440
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:15,750
# Someone
painted echoes on #

441
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,667
# In big black letters #

442
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:18,586
# On the dead inside #

443
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:22,465
# I kept my foot
on the gas #

444
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,341
# As I left the road #

445
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,679
# Blew out my mind #

446
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,975
# 8 miles out of Memphis,
and I got no spare #

447
00:22:32,015 --> 00:22:36,269
# 8 miles straightened up
downtown somewhere #

448
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,273
# I just dropped in #

449
00:22:38,314 --> 00:22:42,693
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

450
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,448
# I said,
I just dropped in #

451
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:50,743
# To see what condition
my condition was in #

452
00:22:50,783 --> 00:22:53,662
# Yeah #

453
00:22:53,703 --> 00:23:00,711
# Oh, yeah #

454
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,310
Ah...

455
00:23:20,104 --> 00:23:22,108
Ah...

456
00:23:25,818 --> 00:23:28,782
Ah...

457
00:23:55,515 --> 00:23:59,354
But the charge was true

458
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:03,649
and they say
he ran away

459
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:04,692
branded!

460
00:24:17,787 --> 00:24:20,457
Is this your only I.D.?

461
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,502
I know my rights,
man.

462
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,756
You don't know shit,
Lebowski.

463
00:24:26,796 --> 00:24:28,675
I want
a fucking lawyer, man.

464
00:24:28,716 --> 00:24:30,551
I want...

465
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:33,010
Bill Kunstler, man.

466
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,849
Or Ron Coobie.

467
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,350
Mr. Treehorn tells us

468
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,644
that he had to eject you
from his garden party,

469
00:24:40,685 --> 00:24:43,564
that you were drunk
and abusive.

470
00:24:43,604 --> 00:24:48,778
Mr. Treehorn treats objects
like women, man.

471
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:51,154
Mr. Treehorn draws
a lot of water in this town.

472
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:53,573
You don't draw shit,
Lebowski.

473
00:24:53,615 --> 00:24:56,952
Now we got a nice quiet
little beach community here,

474
00:24:56,993 --> 00:24:58,872
and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.

475
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:01,750
So let me
make something plain.

476
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,667
I don't like you
sucking around,

477
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,045
bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.

478
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:08,465
I don't like
your jerk-off name,

479
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,466
I don't like
your jerk-off face,

480
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,841
I don't like
your jerk-off behavior,

481
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,676
And I don't like you...

482
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,220
Jerk-off.

483
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,600
Do I make myself clear?

484
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,814
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

485
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,774
Ow!

486
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,152
Fucking fascist!

487
00:25:29,193 --> 00:25:30,653
Aah!

488
00:25:30,693 --> 00:25:32,572
Stay out of Malibu,
Lebowski!

489
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:33,573
Ow!

490
00:25:33,613 --> 00:25:36,367
Stay out of Malibu,
deadbeat!

491
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:38,743
Keep your ugly fucking
gold-bricking ass

492
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,581
out of
my beach community.

493
00:25:41,622 --> 00:25:47,752
# I want to sleep with you
in the desert tonight #

494
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:52,675
# With a billion stars
all around #

495
00:25:52,716 --> 00:25:54,051
Jesus...

496
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,470
Man, could you
change the channel?

497
00:25:56,511 --> 00:25:58,472
Fuck you, man!
if you don't like my music,

498
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,349
get your own fucking cab!

499
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,850
I had a really rough--

500
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,769
I’ll pull over
and kiss your ass out.

501
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,644
Man, come on,
I had a rough night,

502
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:08,189
And I hate
the fucking eagles, man.

503
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,657
Out of my fucking cab!

504
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:16,573
Out! Get--

505
00:26:16,615 --> 00:26:17,573
Hey...

506
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:18,576
Man!

507
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,618
Man, hey!

508
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,680
# Devil-may-care #

509
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,975
# And I’m the devil
with love to spare #

510
00:26:42,015 --> 00:26:46,479
# So viva, Las Vegas #

511
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:49,899
# Viva, Las Vegas #

512
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,662
Oh...

513
00:27:02,702 --> 00:27:04,122
Jesus.

514
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,975
Jeffrey.

515
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:26,350
Maude?

516
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,810
Love me.

517
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,564
Uh, that's my robe.

518
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:35,278
Maude: Tell me about
yourself, Jeffrey.

519
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:37,572
Well, not much
to tell.

520
00:27:37,613 --> 00:27:42,452
I, um, I was one
of the authors

521
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:45,371
of the port Huron
Statement.

522
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:47,247
The original
Port Huron Statement.

523
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,166
Uh-huh.

524
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:52,211
Not the compromised
second draft.

525
00:27:53,586 --> 00:27:56,341
Uh, and then I, uh,

526
00:27:56,381 --> 00:27:57,759
you ever hear
of the Seattle 7?

527
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:58,760
Mmm.

528
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,679
That was me.

529
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,975
And, um,
the 6 other guys.

530
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:09,854
Um, and then
a music business briefly.

531
00:28:09,894 --> 00:28:10,770
Oh?

532
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,149
Yeah, a roadie
for Metallica.

533
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:14,149
Oh.

534
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,068
Speed of sound tour.

535
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:17,944
Mm-hmm.

536
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,448
Bunch of assholes.

537
00:28:20,488 --> 00:28:22,242
Uh, and then,
you know,

538
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:25,161
A little of this,
a little of that.

539
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:28,456
My career's slowed down
a little lately.

540
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:32,377
What do you do
for recreation?

541
00:28:32,417 --> 00:28:37,673
Oh, the usual.
Bowl, drive around.

542
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,716
The occasional
acid flashback.

543
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:48,560
What happened
to your house?

544
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,560
Oh, Jackie Treehorn
trashed the place.

545
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,354
He thought I had
your father's money.

546
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,359
He got me out of the way
while he looked for it.

547
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,359
Cocktail?

548
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,778
No, thanks.

549
00:28:58,818 --> 00:29:00,278
It's not my
father's money.

550
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:02,157
It's the
Foundation's.

551
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,073
Why did he think
you have it?

552
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,577
And who does?

553
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,371
Oh, Larry Sellers,
this high school kid.

554
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:09,747
Real fucking brat.

555
00:29:09,787 --> 00:29:13,167
You know, this is a very
complicated case, Maude.

556
00:29:13,207 --> 00:29:15,961
Lotta ins, lotta outs.

557
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:16,880
You know, fortunately,

558
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,256
I'm adhering to
a pretty strict, uh,

559
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:21,676
drug regiment to keep
my mind, you know,

560
00:29:21,716 --> 00:29:23,676
Uh, limber, you know.

561
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,180
Very fucking close
to your father's money.

562
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,557
I keep telling you it's
the Foundation's money.

563
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,018
Father doesn't have any.

564
00:29:31,894 --> 00:29:33,770
What are you talking about?
he's fucking loaded.

565
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,649
No, no, the wealth
was all mother's.

566
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:38,649
No, he runs stuff, uh--

567
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,069
We did let him run one
of the companies briefly,

568
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,363
But he didn't do
very well at it.

569
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:43,863
No, he's, you know.

570
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,240
No, he helps administer
the charities now,

571
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,661
and I give him
a reasonable allowance.

572
00:29:48,702 --> 00:29:50,078
He has no money
of his own.

573
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,956
I know how he likes
to present himself.

574
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:53,957
Father's weakness
is vanity.

575
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,876
Hence, the slut.

576
00:29:54,917 --> 00:30:00,171
Uh, do you think he, uh--

577
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,548
What is that, yoga?

578
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,010
It increases the chances
of conception.

579
00:30:06,886 --> 00:30:07,845
Increases?

580
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,140
Well, yes.

581
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,640
What did you think
this was all about?

582
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:11,559
Fun and games?

583
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,479
I want a child.

584
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,854
Ok, yeah, ok,
but let me--

585
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,858
Ahem, let me explain
something about The Dude.

586
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,777
Uh, look, Jeffrey,

587
00:30:20,818 --> 00:30:22,278
I don't want
a partner.

588
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,278
In fact, I don't
want the father

589
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,157
to be someone
I have to see socially

590
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:27,573
or who'll have
any interest

591
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,077
in raising
the child himself.

592
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,747
Oh, so that doctor--

593
00:30:32,787 --> 00:30:37,961
Exactly. Now, what
happened to your face?

594
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,877
Did Jackie Treehorn
Do that as well?

595
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:43,756
No, uh, it was the chief
of police of Malibu.

596
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,260
A real reactionary.

597
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:49,180
So, your father...

598
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,055
Oh, yeah, I get it.
Yeah, yeah.

599
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,057
What?

600
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,475
Oh, man, my thinking
about this case

601
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,814
had become very uptight.
Yeah, your father.

602
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:02,693
Jeffrey, what are
you talking about?

603
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,363
Jeffrey!

604
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:06,863
Walter, if you're there,

605
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:10,658
pick up the fucking phone,
man, come on, Walter.

606
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,577
Pick it up, man,
this is an emergency.

607
00:31:12,618 --> 00:31:13,578
Come on, enough--Dude?

608
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,957
Yeah, listen, Walter,
I'm at my place.

609
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:17,375
I need you to come
pick me up.

610
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,877
I can't drive, Dude,
It's Erev Shabbos.

611
00:31:18,917 --> 00:31:22,255
What?
Erev Shabbos.

612
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:24,673
I can't drive.
Man!

613
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,550
I'm not even supposed
to pick up the phone

614
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:27,051
unless it's
an emergency.

615
00:31:27,091 --> 00:31:29,345
This is
a fucking emergency.

616
00:31:29,385 --> 00:31:31,765
I understand. That's why
I picked up the phone.

617
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,140
Walter, you fuck,

618
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,060
we gotta go
to Pasadena, man.

619
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,810
Come pick me up or I’m off
the fucking bowling team.

620
00:31:52,618 --> 00:31:55,287
Get out of that
fucking car, man.

621
00:31:55,787 --> 00:31:58,247
Get out of that
fucking car!

622
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,211
Get the fuck out
of the car, man.

623
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,546
Get out of
the fucking--

624
00:32:04,587 --> 00:32:05,965
Who the fuck
are you, man?

625
00:32:06,006 --> 00:32:08,841
Easy, man.
Relax, man.

626
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,760
No physical harm
intended.

627
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:11,761
Who the fuck
are you?

628
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,180
Why are you
following me around?

629
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,640
Come on, fuckhead.

630
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,060
Relax, man.
I'm a brother Seamus.

631
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,519
Brother Seamus?

632
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,854
Like an Irish monk?

633
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,649
What the fuck are you
talking about?

634
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,149
My name is Da Fino.

635
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,069
I'm a private snoop,
like you, man.

636
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,863
What?

637
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:30,738
A dick, man.

638
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:34,243
And let me tell you
something. I dig your work.

639
00:32:34,283 --> 00:32:35,743
Playing one side
against the other.

640
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,162
In bed with everybody.
Fabulous stuff, man.

641
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,041
I'm not--fuck it, man.

642
00:32:40,082 --> 00:32:42,460
Just stay away from
my fucking lady friend.

643
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,877
Hey, hey, I’m not messing
with your special lady.

644
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,256
She's not
my special lady.

645
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:47,256
She's my fucking
lady friend.

646
00:32:47,296 --> 00:32:49,175
I'm just helping
her conceive, man.

647
00:32:49,216 --> 00:32:50,051
Hey, man, I’m not--

648
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:50,969
Who are you
working for?

649
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,470
Lebowski?

650
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,514
Jackie Treehorn?

651
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,765
The Knutsens.

652
00:32:56,807 --> 00:33:01,060
The--who the fuck
are the Knutsens?

653
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,899
The Knutsen's. It's
a wandering daughter job.

654
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:08,278
Bunny Lebowski, man.

655
00:33:08,318 --> 00:33:11,072
Her real name
is Fawn Knutsen.

656
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:13,573
Her parents want her back.

657
00:33:13,615 --> 00:33:15,868
Jesus fucking Christ.

658
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:18,662
Crazy, huh? Ran away
about a year ago.

659
00:33:18,703 --> 00:33:21,039
The Knutsens told me
I should show her this

660
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,041
when I found her.

661
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,542
It's the family farm.

662
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,961
It's outside of
Moorhead, Minnesota.

663
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,380
They think it'll
make her homesick.

664
00:33:27,421 --> 00:33:29,256
Oh, boy.
How are you gonna

665
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,256
keep 'em
down on the farm

666
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,260
once they've seen
Karl Hungus?

667
00:33:33,301 --> 00:33:34,679
She's been
kidnapped, Da Fino.

668
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,680
Oh, man.

669
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,555
Oh, I don't know.
maybe not,

670
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,557
But she's definitely
not around.

671
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,604
Hey, maybe you and me
could pool our resources.

672
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,564
Trade information.
Professional courtesy.

673
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:48,068
Compeers, you know
what I mean?

674
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,443
Yeah, yeah, I get it.
Fuck off, Da Fino.

675
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:52,363
And stay away
from my special--

676
00:33:52,403 --> 00:33:55,908
From my fucking
lady friend, man.

677
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:00,121
Ze lingonberry
pancakes.

678
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,917
Lingonberry pancakes.

679
00:34:09,212 --> 00:34:12,091
Sree pigs in blanket.

680
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,385
Dieter: Huh?

681
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,805
She has lingonberry
pancakes.

682
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,359
I mean we totally
fucked it up, man.

683
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,274
We fucked up his payoff,

684
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,653
we got the kidnappers
all pissed off,

685
00:34:32,693 --> 00:34:34,572
And Lebowski, you know,
he yelled at me a lot,

686
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,448
But he didn't
do anything, huh?

687
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,368
Well, sometimes
it's a cathartic--

688
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:41,246
No, no, I’m saying if
he knows I’m a fuck-up,

689
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,162
why does he
leave me in charge

690
00:34:42,203 --> 00:34:43,664
Of getting his wife back?

691
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:46,960
Because he doesn't fucking
want her back, man.

692
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,961
He's had enough.
He no longer digs her.

693
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:50,380
It's all a show.

694
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,756
Ok, but then, why
doesn't he give a shit

695
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:54,259
About his million bucks?

696
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,051
I mean, he knows we never
handed off his briefcase,

697
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,555
but he never asked
for it back.

698
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,850
The million bucks was
never in the briefcase.

699
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,979
The briefcase was
fucking empty, man.

700
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:08,856
The asshole was hoping
that they would kill her.

701
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:11,274
You threw out a ringer
for a ringer.

702
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,652
Ok, but how does
this all add up

703
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,653
To an emergency?
Huh?

704
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:17,363
I'm saying I see what
you're getting at, Dude,

705
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,867
He kept the money.

706
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,243
My point is, ahem,

707
00:35:20,283 --> 00:35:22,662
here we are,
it's Shabbos,

708
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:24,662
the Sabbath, which
I'm allowed to break

709
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,457
only if it's a matter
of life or death.

710
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,960
Will you come off it,
Walter?

711
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,252
You're not even
fucking Jewish, man.

712
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,671
What the fuck are
you talking about?

713
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:34,173
You're fucking
Polish-catholic.

714
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,675
What the fuck are
you talking about?

715
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,176
I converted when
I married Cynthia.

716
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:38,551
Come on, Dude.
Yeah, yeah.

717
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,054
You know this.

718
00:35:40,095 --> 00:35:41,972
And 5 fucking years ago,
you were divorced.

719
00:35:42,015 --> 00:35:43,349
So what are saying?
When you get divorced,

720
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,850
You turn in
your library card?

721
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,269
You get a new license?
You stop being Jewish?

722
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,644
This is
the driveway, huh?

723
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,148
I'm Jewish as
fucking Tevye.

724
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,567
Man, you know,
it's all a part

725
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:55,068
of your sick
Cynthia thing.

726
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:56,863
Man, taking care
of her fucking dog.

727
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:58,738
Going to her
fucking synagogue.

728
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:00,658
You're living in
the fucking past.

729
00:36:00,698 --> 00:36:02,158
3,000 years of
beautiful tradition

730
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,077
from Moses
to Sandy Koufax,

731
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,078
you're goddamn right

732
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,956
I'm living in
the fucking past!

733
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:09,250
I--Jesus.

734
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:12,752
What the hell
happened?

735
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:21,095
# Viva Las Vegas #

736
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,645
Ah!

737
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,148
Where was she, man?

738
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,564
Visiting friends of hers
in palm springs.

739
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,068
She just picked up
and left.

740
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,443
Never bothered
to tell us.

741
00:36:36,484 --> 00:36:38,863
Well, I guess the fucking
nihilist knew where she was.

742
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:41,240
Jesus, Dude, she never
even kidnapped herself.

743
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:42,742
Who is this gentleman,
Dude?

744
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,661
Who am I? I'm
a fucking veteran.

745
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,577
He shouldn't go
in there, Dude.

746
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,997
He's very angry.

747
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,251
Hello, man.

748
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:55,671
So, she's back,
no thanks to you.

749
00:36:55,711 --> 00:36:57,548
Where's the fucking
money, Lebowski?

750
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,466
A million bucks
from fucking needy

751
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:00,969
Little urban
achievers!

752
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,345
You are scum, man!

753
00:37:02,385 --> 00:37:03,761
Who the hell is he?

754
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,764
Who am I? Who am I?

755
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,765
I'm the guy
that's gonna kick

756
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:07,640
Your phony goldbricking
ass! That's who I am.

757
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,560
Man, we know the briefcase
was fucking empty.

758
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,479
We know you kept the million
bucks for yourself.

759
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,979
You have your story,
I have mine.

760
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,358
I say I entrusted
the money to you,

761
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,274
And you stole it.

762
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,153
As if we would ever
dream of taking

763
00:37:18,193 --> 00:37:19,569
your bullshit
money!

764
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,948
You thought that Bunny
had been kidnapped,

765
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:23,448
and you were
fucking glad, man.

766
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,452
You could use it as an excuse
to make some money disappear.

767
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,368
All you needed was a sap
to pin it on.

768
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:31,666
You just met me.
You--human paraquat!

769
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,960
You figured, oh,
here's a loser, you know.

770
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:36,377
A deadbeat.
somebody the square community

771
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:37,380
Won't give a shit about.

772
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,506
Well, aren't you?

773
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,176
Well, yeah, but--

774
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,470
Get out, both of you.

775
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,470
Look at that
fucking phony, Dude.

776
00:37:45,511 --> 00:37:47,347
Pretending to be a
fucking millionaire.

777
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,768
Out of this house now,
you bums!

778
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,269
Let me tell you
something else.

779
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,644
I've seen a lot of
spinals, Dude,

780
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,564
And this guy's
a fake.

781
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,939
A fucking
goldbricker.

782
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,443
Stay away from me,
mister!

783
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,359
This guy
fucking walks.

784
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,444
I've never been
more certain

785
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:02,863
of anything
in my life.

786
00:38:02,904 --> 00:38:03,738
You stay away from me!

787
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,242
Walter, for Christ’s sake,
man, he's a cripple.

788
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,658
Come on, come on.

789
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,661
Get away from me!

790
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:10,578
Aah!

791
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,456
Put him down, man!

792
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,872
Yeah, I’ll put
him down, Dude!

793
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:18,002
Rauss! Achtung, baby!

794
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,104
Come on, man, help me
put him back in his chair.

795
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,542
Sure, you'll see
some tank battles.

796
00:38:55,582 --> 00:38:57,460
But fighting in desert
is very different

797
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,877
from fighting
in canopy jungle.

798
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:01,840
I mean 'nam was
a foot soldier's war.

799
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,051
Whereas, this thing
should, uh, you know,

800
00:39:05,091 --> 00:39:06,551
should be
a piece of cake.

801
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,970
I mean, I had
an M16, Jacko.

802
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,847
Not an Abrams
fucking tank.

803
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:12,350
Me and Charlie,
eyeball to eyeball.

804
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,268
Yeah.

805
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,769
That's fuckin' combat.

806
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,148
The man in the
black pajamas, Dude.

807
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,064
Worthy fuckin'
adversary.

808
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:21,067
Who's in
pajamas, Walter?

809
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:23,443
Shut the fuck up,
Donny.

810
00:39:23,484 --> 00:39:25,863
Whereas, what we
have here...

811
00:39:25,903 --> 00:39:27,740
Lots of fig-eaters wearing
towels on their heads,

812
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,743
trying to find reverse
on a soviet tank.

813
00:39:29,783 --> 00:39:31,577
This--this is not
a worthy--

814
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:32,577
Hey!

815
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:34,872
What's this
day of rest shit?

816
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,750
What's this bullshit!

817
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:38,167
I don't fuckin' care!

818
00:39:38,207 --> 00:39:39,667
It don't matter
to Jesus.

819
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,171
But you not
fooling me, man.

820
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:43,546
You might fool the fucks
in the league office,

821
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:45,966
but you don't
fool Jesus.

822
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:48,845
It's bush league
psyche-out stuff.

823
00:39:48,885 --> 00:39:51,264
Laughable, man. Ha ha!

824
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:55,143
I would have fucked you
in the ass Saturday.

825
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:58,354
I’ll fuck you in the ass
Next Wednesday instead.

826
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:01,899
Whoo! You got a date
Wednesday, baby.

827
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:07,947
He's cracking.

828
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,948
The whole concept of Asia.

829
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:11,367
I mean, many learned men
have disputed this,

830
00:40:11,408 --> 00:40:16,706
but in the 14th century.
the rabahm, he--

831
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,840
Well, they
finally did it.

832
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:28,341
They killed
my fucking car.

833
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,679
We want some money,
Lebowski.

834
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,055
Ja, otherwise,
we kill the girl.

835
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,975
Ja, it seems
you have forgotten

836
00:40:36,015 --> 00:40:37,560
Our little deal,
Lebowski.

837
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,479
You don't have the
fucking girl, dipshit.

838
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,856
We know you never did.

839
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,274
Are these the Nazis,
Walter?

840
00:40:44,317 --> 00:40:45,777
No, Donny, these men
are nihilists.

841
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,193
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

842
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,948
Vee don't care. Vee
still want the money,

843
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,158
Lebowski, or
we'll fuck you up.

844
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,078
Fuck you.
Fuck the 3 of yous.

845
00:40:57,122 --> 00:41:00,457
No, without a hostage,
there is no ransom.

846
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,876
That's what ransom is.

847
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,877
Those are the fucking rules.

848
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,880
His girlfriend
gave up her toe.

849
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,256
She zought we'd be
getting $1 million.

850
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,676
It's not fair.

851
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:13,054
Fair? Who's the fucking
nihilist around here?

852
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,470
You bunch of
fucking crybabies.

853
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,850
Cool it, Walter.
Hey, look, pal,

854
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,850
There never was
any money.

855
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,644
The big Lebowski gave
me an empty briefcase,

856
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:23,064
So take it up
with him, man.

857
00:41:23,104 --> 00:41:25,442
Yeah, and I would like
my undies back.

858
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,443
Are these guys gonna
hurt us, Walter?

859
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,862
No, Donny, these
men are cowards.

860
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:32,157
Ok, so we take ze
money you haf on you

861
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,117
And we calls it
even.

862
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,077
Fuck you.

863
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,452
Hey, no, come on,
Walter, come on.

864
00:41:37,493 --> 00:41:39,372
We're ending this
thing cheap, man.

865
00:41:39,412 --> 00:41:40,372
No, what's mine is mine.

866
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,372
Oh, come on, Walter.

867
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:42,751
Dieter:
No funny stuff.

868
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,670
All right,

00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,465
Uh, 4 bucks,

I got $18.

871
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,341
Walter: What's

Dieter: We fuck you up.

875
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:01,478
Show me what
you got, nihilist.

876
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,854
I fuck you.

877
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:03,854
Walter, come on,
he's got a sword.

878
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:06,274
Fucking dipshit with
a 9-toed woman.

879
00:42:06,314 --> 00:42:07,649
Fuck you!

880

Here's the $4.00.

883
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,502
I got a fucking ball, man.

884
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,296
Aah!

885
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,176
Anti-semite!

886
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:35,051

00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:36,470

We got a man down, Dude.

890
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:54,779
God, they shot him,
man.

891
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:55,657
No, Dude.

892
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,658
They shot Donny?

893
00:42:56,698 --> 00:42:57,573
There weren't
any shots fired.

894
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:59,577
Huh?
It's a heart attack.

895
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,953
Call the medics, Dude.

896
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,872
I'd go myself, but I’m
pumping blood. Might pass out.

897
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:08,545
Rest easy, good buddy,
you're doing fine.

898
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,586
We got help
choppering in.

899
00:43:36,904 --> 00:43:39,743
Hello, gentlemen.
You are the bereaved?

900
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,161
Yeah, man.

901
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,578
Francis Donnelly.
Pleased to meet you.

902
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,081
Jeff Lebowski.

903
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,457
Walter Sobchak.

904
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:49,377
The Dude, actually,
is, uh--

905
00:43:49,417 --> 00:43:50,377
Excuse me?

906
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,755
Oh, nothing.

907
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:57,551
Yes, I understand you're
taking away the remains.

908
00:43:57,594 --> 00:43:59,470
Yeah.

909
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,265
We have the urn.

910
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:05,310
I assume this is
credit card.

911
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,103
Yeah.

912
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,198
Walter: Ahem.

913
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:21,951
What's this?

914
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:24,871
That's for the urn.

915
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,164
Don't need it. We're
Scattering the ashes.

916
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:30,251
Yes, so we
Were informed.

917
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,167
However, we must,
Of course,

918
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:35,090
Transmit the remains
To you in a receptacle.

919
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,466
This is $180.

920
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,261
It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

921
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,640
Can we just, uh--$180?

922
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,559
They range up to 3,000.

923
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,560
Uh, we're, uh, ahem!

924
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,479
Can't we just
rent it from you?

925
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:53,358
Sir, this is a mortuary,
not a rental house.

926
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,068
We're scattering
the fucking ashes!

927
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,568
Look, just because
we're bereaved,

928
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:57,568
Doesn't
make us saps!

929
00:44:57,612 --> 00:45:00,448
Sir, please,
lower your voices.

930
00:45:00,488 --> 00:45:01,865
Man, don't you have,
you know,

931
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:05,743
Something else we could
put him in, you know?

932
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,664
That is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

933
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,707
God damn it!

934
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,502
Is there a Ralph’s
around here?

935
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,279
Donny was
a good bowler

936
00:45:41,322 --> 00:45:43,658
And a good man.

937
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:45,577
He was one of us.

938
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:49,247
He was a man who loved
the outdoors and bowling.

939
00:45:49,287 --> 00:45:51,247
And as a surfer,
he explored the beaches

940
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,167
of Southern California,

941
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:56,171
from La Jolla
to Leo Carrillo

942
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,046
and up to Pismo.

943
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,845
He died--he died as so
many men of his generation,

944
00:46:03,885 --> 00:46:05,261
Before his time.

945
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:08,640
In your wisdom, Lord,
you took him.

946
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:12,060
As you took so many bright,
flowering young men

947
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,354
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

948
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:17,649
and Hill 364.

949
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:20,068
These young men
gave their lives.

950
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:23,948
So did Donny.

951
00:46:23,988 --> 00:46:25,908
Donny who loved bowling.

952
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:34,542
And so, Theodore
Donald Karabatsos,

953
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:37,377
in accordance with
what we think

954
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,756
your dying wishes
might well have been,

955
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,551
We commit your final
mortal remains

956
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:48,347
To the bosom
of the pacific ocean,

957
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,390
which you loved so well.

958
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:54,310
Good night, sweet prince.

959
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:09,993
Shit.

960
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,414
Oh, shit, Dude,
I'm sorry.

961
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:16,751
God damn wind.

962
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,670
God damn it, Walter.

963
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:20,171
You fucking asshole!

964
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:21,046
Dude, I’m sorry.

965
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,966
Everything's a fucking
travesty with you, man.

966
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,966
I'm sorry.
It was an accident.

967
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,845
What was that shit
About Vietnam?

968
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,761
What the fuck
does anything

969
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:30,265
have to do
with Vietnam?

970
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,640
What the fuck are
you talking about?

971
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,100
Dude, I’m sorry.

972
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,313
Fuckin'...

973
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,613
Fuck, Walter.

974
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:51,493
Come on, Dude.
Hey, fuck it, man.

975
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,207
Let's go bowling.

976
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:22,442
And when you're
sitting there

977
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:26,778
in your silk
upholstered chair

978
00:48:26,819 --> 00:48:31,783
talkin' to some rich folks
that you know

979
00:48:33,912 --> 00:48:37,872
well, I hope
you don't see me

980
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:41,667
in my ragged company

981
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:47,091
Aw, that you know
I could never be alone

982
00:48:48,591 --> 00:48:50,470
2 oat sodas, Gary.

983
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:51,345
Good luck tomorrow.

984
00:48:51,385 --> 00:48:52,845
Yeah, thanks, man.

985
00:48:52,889 --> 00:48:54,765
I'm sorry to hear
about Donny.

986
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:58,060
Oh, well, yeah,
you know,

987
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,479
Sometimes you
eat the bar,

988
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,356
And sometimes,
you know--

989
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:04,274
Hey, man!

990
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,777
Howdy doo, Dude.

991
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:07,653
I wondered if I’d
see you again.

992
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:09,572
I wouldn't
miss the semis?

993
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,073
How have things
been going?

994
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:12,951
Oh, you know,
strikes and gutters,

995
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,368
ups and downs.

996
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:15,868
Sure. I gotcha.

997
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:19,164
Yeah. Thanks, Gary.

998
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,667
Well, take care, man.
Gotta get back.

999
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:23,461
Sure. Take it
easy, Dude.

1000
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,377
Oh, yeah.

1001
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:26,756
I know that you will.

1002
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:30,801
Yeah, well,
The Dude abides.

1003
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:39,519
The Dude abides.

1004
00:49:42,188 --> 00:49:46,568
I don't know about you,
but I take comfort in that.

1005
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,278
It's good knowing he's
out there, The Dude.

1006
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,658
Takin' her easy
for all us sinners.

1007
00:49:53,698 --> 00:49:58,953
Shoosh. I sure hope
he makes the finals.

1008
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,872
Well, that about does her.

1009
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,752
Wraps her all up.

1010
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,670
Things seemed to have
worked out pretty good

1011
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:08,046
for The Dude and Walter.

1012
00:50:08,087 --> 00:50:10,048
And it was
a pretty good story,

1013
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:12,051
Don't you think?

1014
00:50:12,091 --> 00:50:14,845
Made me laugh
to beat the band.

1015
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:17,640
Parts, anyway.

1016
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:21,060
I didn't like
seeing Donny go.

1017
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,479
But then
I happen to know

1018
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:27,274
That there's a little
Lebowski on the way.

1019
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:29,778
I guess that's how the
whole darn human comedy

1020
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,573
keeps perpetuating itself

1021
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,948
down through
the generations.

1022
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:37,452
westward in the wagons,

1023
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:41,247
and across the sands
of time until we--

1024
00:50:41,287 --> 00:50:42,539
Oh, look at me.

1025
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:45,460
I'm ramblin' again.

1026
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:48,377
Well, I hope you folks
enjoyed yourselves.

1027
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:51,756
Catch ya later
on down the trail.

1028
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,676
Say, friend,
you got any more

1029
00:50:53,716 --> 00:50:55,720
of that goodSarsaparilla?
